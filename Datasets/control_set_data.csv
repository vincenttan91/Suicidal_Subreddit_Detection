A while back there was this big get together to celebrate the latern festival. I had about 2 bottles of beer that's about it. I was definitely sober, I had full control of what I was doing. So I went up to this girl same age. We knew each other before but never spoke. We were in a group just walking. She did not have any alcohol at this point. I put my arm around her waist (nowhere near her ass). And we talk for a bit. Just small talk like how we have never met, tell her my name etc. In this time she does not move away or tell me to go away or any sign of discomfort. During this time She actually puts her arm around my waist as well. I wanted to leave the group and meet some other friends so I turn to her and tell her how beautiful she was tonight and just left . That was the end of our interaction. 

A few days pass and I find out that she actually went around her school saying that I raped/took advantage of her which I absolutely did not. The extent of physical contact was arms  around her waist. My friends also get the news and now whenever I talk to a girl they tease me and call me a rapist. I don't want to confront the girl because if she denies it then I would make me look even worse. 

Why on earth would she call me a rapist?
What do I do ?

I can't believe on the stupidity of this situation, but here we go.   

My parents at home just told me my aunt is coming to stay a few days, and I have to spare my room for her to use. I'm usually pretty chill about this, but here's the thing: That aunt is a **confirmed** carrier of Corona virus, yet shes coming here and my parents are okay with it...? WTF?  

As to how exactly she's allowed to travel: she's **not.** This is Illegal and dangerous but it seems i have no say on the matter... my only hope is to avoid getting infected. I need help, what should I do with an infected person on the house?

// Update #1

Due to the amount of advices saying that I should report this, I really feel the need to now. I'm typing this as she's on a plane, on her way here, so avoiding that is no longer possible... 

I will contact the local police department, they should be here before she arrives and I'm definitely getting into trouble... But if i think really hard about it, my parents caused this, not me. It's easier that way.

// Update #2

So... This escalated quickly. I called the non emergency line and told them a family member was coming to the house and they were a carrier of Corona. My city is on a lockdown since the growing cases of the last week so I expected the police to come over stay with us until aunt arrives, and they would tell us what to do. Not so...

Police arrived, took my parents for interrogation and one of them told me my aunt is being intercepted. Holy, fuck.

I'm alone in my house now, it's night, and looks like they're not gonna be here til tomorrow. I think updates will stop for now but for sure I won't be seeing aunt so soon. Might have been the right thing to do but I'm definitely screwed... In a month from now I might be here on the sub again asking how do I adapt to a new home, I'm 20 and I have a day job so my chances of getting kicked out after this are really high :(

Thank you for all the advice. No doubt, it was the best course of action.

// Post storm update #3

Aunt is being kept at the hospital, she indeed has the virus, and i don't know yet if shes gonna be fined for the trip or not, but I imagine she will : / 

For those asking, she's not here to just visit, she came *because* of the symptoms. She wanted family contact cause she feared not having another chance (an over reaction, i know).

I haven't been kicked out, but parents are not talking to me. To those sending lovely messages saying I should already have my own house: I'm not rich, I pay for my own food and transport and the only things I get from this house are the roof and people to talk to during breakfast as I work during the day and study at night. I don't hate my parents, they're good people, just clueless when it comes to common sense sometimes.

So that's it, crisis averted. I'm not getting infected by this god awful virus and aunt should be ok in a week, back to her home to pay the debts. I'll try cooking some nice things and bringing some god news to the table more frequently so my parents forget about this episode, but thanks for all the support in the majority of the comments, good to know this went a lot smoother than hiding in my own house.

I just found out our recently ultra-religious mother plans to have his funeral in her Roman Catholic faith... and I ""cannot"" be a pallbearer unless I carry his body to and from the altar. I need some advice.  I am so outraged, so livid, that I actually have been spluttering when trying to talk about it.

My little brother died Saturday after a 3 year battle with cancer.

TL;DR:  My brother (and I) hate(d) religion, and his burial ceremony is to be conducted in the Roman Catholic tradition because our mother ""found"" god in the last half decade.  I feel this is an incredible disrespect to his memory.  I will be unable to be a pallbearer unless I participate in the Mass.

Atheists, do *not* downvote those whom are religious.  Religious types, return the favor please, and do not downvote those opinions you disagree with.  Be civil.

Details:

He was exceedingly anti-religious throughout his life.  Not militantly atheist, where he wanted to tear down all religions and etc, but actively detested religion broadly because of the thought control and hypocrisy of it.

He hated how religion preached peace... *except kill all who do not believe the correct way.*

 He hated how religion preached understanding...  *unless someone thought differently*

He hated how religion preached love... *unless you didn't bow down, and then eternal torment*.

He hated how religion always seemed to act exactly like the leaders of North Korea... act like you love me, do what I say, or forever be imprisoned and tortured.

He hated how religion said one could rape, murder, destroy lives... *but as long as you said sorry at some point it was all good*.

He hated how religious ""leaders"" could molest children, but it was all good because they spoke for the ""invisible sky wizard"".

And yet if you lived your life being the most generous, loving, giving person to the point of sacrificing yourself for the betterment of others... you were still allegedly going to be tortured for eternity simply because you did such things because they are the way any of us should be, instead of because Bugs Bunny said we should, and needs must worship Daffy Duck.

My little brother, my best friend throughout my life, the person I have fought beside against the world of both far-right and far-left racism, idiocy, hypocrisy, and hate...

...is to be buried in a Roman Catholic Mass/ceremony, because our mother.  A mother that until 5 years or so was non-religious (not anti, like Brother and I, but scoffed at it) until she moved to Oregon where her sister lives (and whose son is a Roman Catholic Father/priest).

So, the advice I need:

As mentioned... I am outraged and very, very, very, *very*, *VERY* appalled and angry.  I feel that this is an extreme insult to my brother's memory.

I will conduct myself with utmost propriety, despite my inclinations to shout out how much my brother would hate what is going on ""in his honor"".  Heck, if there is ever to be a zombie uprising, this would set it off... as Brother would burst out if his casket if he could.

I will be approached by my mother and asked if I have ""calmed down""/accepted Jesus Christ since being notified that Brother will be laid to rest with full Roman Catholic ceremony.

I plan on asking her if *she* would have ""calmed down"" and accepted Muhammed if Aunt Gail (my aunt, her sister) was buried in the Muslim faith. 

I don't want this to be a shitshow.  The only person I have ever unconditionally loved -and who unconditionally loved me back- is dead.

I do not want to profane his memory... and yet, the very ""ceremony"" for his funeral is exactly that.

I think I will just *seethe*, and go along with it.  Any sort of confrontation would be worse.

But Reddit, as weird as it may be to ask complete strangers...

They met through a summer camp two years ago, as he was one of her group leaders. They became ‘friends’ and exchanged phone numbers. Sometime within the past few months, they’ve begun ‘dating’ according to my sister. They apparently confessed their feelings for one another over a phone call and he proceeded to ask her out. She accepted and proudly refers to this creep as her boyfriend. 

My parents seem to have no problem with this whatsoever. My Dad initially was concerned and as angry as I am but I believe the combination of my mother talking to him / my father actually meeting the perv brainwashed my Dad into seeing things in a different way. I’ve brought up my concerns on multiple occasions but my parents constantly shut me down and have even accused me of causing unnecessary tension and trying to destroy a ‘pure relationship’. 

I’ve considered going to the police but the fact is they aren’t having sex. I know this for a fact because my sister and the sicko are never left alone. He apparently made a promise to my parents that he’s willing to wait as long as possible if it means he can remain my sisters boyfriend. For whatever reason, they fall right into this bullshit and act like they want what’s best for my sister.

I probably didn’t explain enough but I’m just so utterly lost, angry, confused, ect. I honestly can’t even put into words how I really feel. I’m her 22 year old brother and I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders to save her from this sick freak. I know talking to my sister won’t do anything, my parents are a lost cause, and I simply don’t have any evidence of legal wrongdoing. All I know is this will not end well if something doesn’t happen. I love my parents but I’ll be the first to admit they are beyond wack.

I want to believe they are choosing to see this as a ‘phase’ in her life or are secretly plotting to catch the guy but deep down I know that’s not the case. They truly believe he’s a good guy and possibly their future son in law which just makes me ill to even think about."

So a bit of back story; 

Been with my current gf 6 years. Happy relationship etc.

One night I was going with her to a family party but she ended up being called into work. As I am still close with her family I decided I'd still go knowing she would meet me there later.

A few hours passed and my gf rang and said she was going to have to stay in all night. 

I ended up getting super drunk with her sister (around my age) and we ended up having unprotected sex. In the morning we both agreed it was stupid and we would keep our mouths shut so we didn't break up the family. 

Anyway now she is pregnant and told everyone else it was a ""one night stand"" but it is confirmed mine.

My gf is so excited for her sister to have the baby and it's driving me insane.

What do I do?


#Also;

sister is keeping the baby but is not interested in me being a "" dad "" to it. Family is quite rich so I don't think she will have any issues supporting the child.


#Also; 

no DNA test done but sister claims I have been only sexual contact within time period needed to impregnate.

#Also; 

How would I even tell her?

Help me... I (M23) have been married to my wife for just over 5 years. We have a 4 year old daughter.

For the past week or two, I've had my suspicions that my wife was talking to someone and/or cheating on me. Last night after I got home, when she was asleep I checked her phone and confirmed my suspicions.

She has been talking to a co-worker, and the texts from the past two days (previous texts were deleted) ranged from both of them saying ""I love you"" to making plans today for him to come to my house today while I am at work. While they didn't definitively say they were going to have sex, it was STRONGLY implied. There is some evidence of other sexual acts already having taken place.

I am now sitting at a Waffle house after calling in to work to say I'm not coming in. I'm planning on trying to get proof of the visit if he does come over by watching when my alarm is armed/dis-armed (through the app on my phone).

After my research, if it ends in divorce, if I can prove she has committed adultry, she will not be eligible for any alimony in my state.

I could stop them from having sex by going home and confronting her before it happens, but it could cost me a lot in the long run if our marriage does fall apart. I love her and don't want it to end, but I can't see how I can forgive her for this. Even if I confronted her now, I would always still feel the same as if she did have sex with him.

This hurts so much. I love her more than anything, and I feel like there is a hole in my chest, and lead in my stomach. I am physically hungry, but can't bring myself to eat because I am so nauseous. I can't stop shaking, I can't think straight, I feel like a part of me has been ripped out. I am terrified of what this will mean for my life, and more that that, the life of my daughter. I don't know what to do...

UPDATE:
First off thanks for the silver. Too bad my first reddit award had to be for this, but thanks nonetheless.

Huge thanks to everyone for all the advice, suggestions, and support. While I still feel physically sick, I am able to think clearer thanks to everyone. I will keep you all updated as this unfolds.

2nd UPDATE:
I just want to say thanks... again. I haven't left this  post since I created it, and I've still not stopped reading. This is the only thing keeping me sane right now. If you are just getting here, please don't think because there are 250+ comments that your opinion/advice isn't important. I've read every single comment with an open mind, and I am factoring all of them into what I do.. also it really helps.. a lot.

I have yet to confront them, as the guy hasn't shown up, and I don't think he will... today atleast. Maybe she caught on that I knew. I tried to play it like nothing was wrong this morning when I left, but damn did it hurt. Not sure if she bought it. In their texts, they planned for him to come over Thursday morning (it is currently 12:40pm). If he doesn't show up, I think I'm going to talk to her about it tonight.

3RD UPDATE:
Every single one of you are awesome. You're really helping me get through this. The guy never showed up, so here is the current plan: I'm going to act like nothing is wrong for now. After talking to you all, and family, I think I can put on to act like nothing is wrong. I'll go see a lawyer in the morning, and I talked to a PI that I'll probably be hiring. I know from the texts that she planned on having him come over during the hunting trip I have planned for next weekend, so I'm going to make sure I go, and that the PI knows. I think I've decided I'm done. I don't want to try to fix it. I'm going to cover my ass, and get out. It's not just an affair in the sense that she's having sex. She tells him she loves him, and she doesn't seem to love me anymore. I feel like she's trying to use me. She wanted a new car, and for me to pay for her to go to school, but wanted to be with him.

Currently, she left to (presumably) pick up my daughter from daycare. I'm watching the time. I know how long it should take. If she takes longer, I can guess where she went. Either way, I'm going to try to make it through Christmas, and my daughter's birthday next Friday without saying anything about this. Hopefully the PI can find evidence then. Wish me luck.

UPDATE 4; GET READY, THIS IS A BIG ONE:
So I came home, and acted normal. Everything seemed normal. We joked a bit, and fuck if that doesn't hurt when you're heartbroken, and had dinner. Sitting on the couch after dinner she asks me to pause the TV, and asks when I was gonna mention ""it"". I asked what ""it"" was, and she said she knew I saw the texts. Start the conversation.

She tells me that he didn't come over (which I obviously knew) and that she told him she doesn't want to talk to him anymore. She blocked his number. Obviously since she has done this the original plan is off the table.

I still love her. My heart is broken, I dont know if I can ever forgive her or trust her; I don't know if I can be in a relationship with her. She want's to work on us. I don't know if I am willing to or not.

She says she was talking to him because she didn't feel wanted. She didn't feel a deep emotional connection between us and he ""knew all the right things to say."" She said she told him she couldn't be with him and told him multiple times she was done with him, yet here she is inviting him to our house. She said it wasn't a choice what she felt for him. The exact story was along the lines of ""He was bagging at my register one day, and I accidentally touched his hand, and it was like electricity."" I know you're probably reading this, and thinking it's a load of BS... Yeah me too. How am I supposed to trust her? I can't see her side of this.

Should I give her a chance? Should I try to work on things? I don't know. Do I want to? Is it worth it? I have to figure all this out. I told her I can't decide now. I have to think about it.

I'm thinking about asking some co-workers (no family in town, perks of being in the Military) if I can crash on their couch for a few days. Get away from it all and think. Of course I'd come back for Christmas for my daughters sake.

I don't see any point in hiring the PI now, as I genuinely don't think she'd so anything for a while. Maybe I'm wrong. Obviously I have been before. I'm taking plenty of precautions in the mean time to make sure I know what she is doing, and if anything is questionable, I'm done. Of course I won't tell her about any of this.

This will be my last update for today. Please continue to offer your perspective and advice, but I think this is largely a decision I'll have to make after due consideration.

UPDATE 5; UNANSWERED QUESTIONS, MY FEELINGS, AND THE PLAN:
I'm going to do a little Q&amp;A section for the most asked questions.

Q: How did she find out I know?
A: Two ways. She had a strong suspicion that I knew because when she woke up, there was a notification on her phone for a new screenshot, but when she clicked it, there was no file. She was 100% sure I knew once she found this post. Yup she's seen it, she's probably reading this now. Hi wife. We'll get more into that later.

Q: What did she say when I asked if she had sex with him?
A: She said no. I am inclined to believe her, because many of the texts, including some the last ones, he was saying how excited he was to ""finally see how hot [her] pussy is"" &lt;---that's a direct quote from him from the texts btw. No does this mean I believe that she didn't? No. Not at all. It doesn't change how I feel whether she did or not. She planned on it, and probably would've if I hadn't found out. It'll be a long time before we ever are intimate again, if we ever are
 I will definitely have us both checked for STDs.

Q: How do I know she won't do it again?
A: Obviously I don't. If we try to fix things, I'll probably never be able to fully trust her again. She is going to have to prove that she will be 100% honest with me. Here's the first test: To my wife-If you are reading this, text me NOW; text me right now and tell me. Stop reading and text me. I will know if you have read it and don't tell me. It will be over.

Some info on the comments I've seen:
I'd say roughly 80-90% of you are telling me to lawyer up and leave her. Of that 80-90%, around 20% is actually making any kind of argument as to why I should rather just saying ""Once a cheater, always a cheater."" or something similar.
The other 10-20% are telling me to either give it a shot, or to do what I want/what makes me happy. The majority of those posters are making good arguments as to why I should stay.
Thank you to everyone that has commented. It means so much to me that some many internet strangers have taken the time to try and help or comfort me.
Also, please don't downvote people because you don't agree with their opinion. Everyone's opinion matters, even if it doesn't align with yours.

I feel like in update 4, I represented her wrongly. She was saying that she did what she did with him because she felt unwanted, but she understood that it was her fault. She knows she should have talked to me. She knows she is the one in the wrong. She says she doesn't blame me for it. I didn't push her away and make her do this. She said she could control how she felt for him (which I still have a hard time believing), but she could've controlled what she did. She let him talk her into it because I think that even if she doesn't realize it, it's what she wanted at the time.

Our marriage hasn't been perfect. We've had issues. We've had issues communicating, especially lately. We've not had a great sex life. I felt like she didn't care enough, and she felt like I didn't care enough. Neither of us tried enough to work on it. Does that mean I blame myself for this? Fuck no. Not even a little. She did this, and she knows that's how I feel.

I'm not trying to make you guys like her, I just want you to understand that I don't think, and never did think, that she is a whore that is a terrible person. She is a terrible wife for what she did to me, but in general is not a bad person.

Now, for the plan going forward:
I thought long and hard (ha) last night and this morning about what I wanted. What would make ME happy. I'm not going to make the decision to stay or leave based on what she wants. I'm not going to decide to stay to keep out family together. I have to make it based on what I want. I want to stay with her... but that doesn't mean I've decided to. I want us to work things out and talk to counselors and our marriage be better than ever, but I have no idea if that will happen.

After I knew she read this post, I knew that she knew about the SC law on adultery, and that she wouldn't be entitled to alimony if she was caught. That was my only defense. Now that she knows, I don't think she'd do anything with anyone for a long time, which means that hiring a PI now or when I go hunting next weekend would be useless, however if she's reading this and knew I wasn't hiring one, she could think she could get away with it. I'm putting some safeguards in place to ensure that doesn't happen, or if it does I have proof.

I came up with an idea. I knew I couldn't and wouldn't trust her for a long time if ever again if we tried to fix things. I figured out the only thing that can even start to make me believe that MAYBE she actually wants to stay with me for me and work on our relationship, and not stay with me for what I can do for her. I asked her if she would sign a postnuptial agreement. I'll have to talk to a lawyer still, but if she will agree to sign a contract that if we divorce, even at no-fault, she gets nothing. No alimony, no possessions except certain outlined things that are undeniably hers (her computer, her clothes, her jewelry, etc.), and no child support. (Let me clarify this because I've gotten a couple of comments about it; I wouldn't not support my daughter and I wouldn't keep my daughter from her, I'd just like to avoid court ordered child support, and give her x amount to support my daughter based on how long she has her at any given time, rather than x amount per month). I don't know how it would work, hence why I have to talk to a lawyer and make sure I can do it like that. 

I have further plans, but I will not be posting them here as she may see this, and those plans involve her not knowing about them. I may reveal them later on, but it will be long from now.

At this point, if the postnuptial agreement works how I hope, and she signs it, I think I'd be willing to TRY to work on things. I know a lot of you aren't going to like this. Maybe she is lying to me. Maybe she really is just a piece of shit... but I knew her before she did this. I knew her before our marriage degraded. I don't think she did it because she wanted to have sex with someone else. I don't think she did it because she doesn't love me. I think she did it because he was telling her the exact same things I used to when we were first together. I think she misses what we used to be, and while we will never be what we used to be, this will go one of theee ways. Either we try to work on things, it doesn't work out, and we get a divorce. We try to work on things, she continues to cheat, and we get a divorce. Or, we try to work on things, we fix problems we have had with ourselves and our marriage since we first got together, and our marriage and relationship will be stronger than it has ever been. I'm hoping for the latter.

I love you guys. You are awesome. The amount of support I've gotten has been overwhelming. I'm still reading every (top-level) comment, and message I get. Shout out to the fella that gave me my first gold, and a huge shout out to the champ that gave me my first platinum. Please, continue to let me know what you think. I know a lot of you won't be happy with my decision, or will be disappointed in me, but I've gotta do this for me.

Quick add on to my latest update:
She has TERRIBLE self image issues. She thinks the worst of herself. She's also super introverted and doesn't get to know many people. This is the first job she's had where she's been around other people in years. Of course this doesn't excuse anything, but I felt like it was relevant.

P.S. Next update will probably be after next week. 

UPDATE 6:
Hey guys. Sorry I've made you wait for an update.  Currently sitting at the bar, drinking some Jack &amp; coke.

So we talked. We tried to work things out, and it seemed like it was getting better. Then she said that she wasn't sure how she felt or if she wanted to try. We talked so more and she said she did want to try. We had a session of counseling with a therapist Wednesday.

The counseling went more or less like this. She said she felt like she wasn't getting enough out of the marriage, and that I didn't care or talk to her. The therapist asked her some questions and she answered basically saying she could tell I did care and did talk to her (or try to anyway). The therapist kinda explained to her that it wasn't that I didn't care (by her own admission), and instead that she just wasn't happy with it and didn't know what she wanted. Well, she decided what she wanted.

Last night she started setting up an air mattress in the extra room, and I saw she had some new sheets that she had ordered to fit it. I looked at her phone to see when she had ordered them, and she was texting him again.

So obviously, we're done. We will be getting a divorce. I know a lot of you are going to say ""I told you so"", but I was 100% aware this was a possibility when I tried to work things out, and I don't regret it at all. I will look back on this in the future and know I did everything I could to fix things. I have nothing left to regret, and that makes me happy. I tried, and I can never blame myself now.

Now, before anyone says it, please refrain from calling her a bitch, or just generally talking shit about my wife. As you cant just stop loving at will, I still love her. Telling me how shitty a person she is doesn't help.

I don't forgive her, and I may never, but i don't resent her. I still want the best for her and out daughter and want her to be happy. I genuinely believe she regrets hurting me, but (at least believes that) can't help how she feels. We are done, but she is currently planning to move back to Florida with her family, which means leaving this guy too.

She doesn't think she can be happy with me anymore, but I don't really think she's leaving me to be with him. In my opinion, she is excited about the pursuit. The ""puppy dog"" love that you get when you meet someone new. I think she is damaged, and needs help to figure out herself, and her self-deprecation issues.

She will be staying here in our house for the time being, and seeing a therapist (hopefully) while she still gets the benefit of it being married to me. By SC law, we will have to live apart for a year before we can file for the divorce, but she will be leaving relatively soon.

We have agreed to do mediation instead of having lawyers involved to save us money and fighting. We still get along well enough. She has agreed that she will not pursue alimony, and I think she will be giving me full custody of our daughter if the courts accept it, but with her still getting as much visitation as possible. 

I won't try to fuck her over, as much as you guys will tell me too, and although I love you all for all the support and everything you have done for me, you don't know me, and you don't know her. She's not a terrible person. I truly believe she is telling me the truth and won't try to fuck me over either.

It's gonna be rough for a long time, but we'll make it through this. The most important thing to me right now is making sure our daughter is taken care of, and that we do what is best for her.

I'm on drink #4 now, and getting tired of typing, so I'm done for now, but if I left out any details (and I'm sure I did) feel free to ask, and I will reply to any questions, as well as updating the update to include the details I left out.

I appreciate you all more than you can know, and I wish I could afford to give each and every one of you medals, but unfortunately I can't. If anyone is in the Columbia, SC area, I'd love a drinking buddy (now or later). I'm buying... unless like 40 people try to come. Have a great day. Thanks for reading. Thanks for everything. You're amazing."

A few days ago, I made a post titled “I think my son is gay”, I said that I wanted to get some time off work so that I could talk to him and hopefully get him to come out.

Here is a link to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/afp5jv/i_think_my_son_is_gay/?st=JR0QSZ28&amp;sh=ad7bd9c9

I was overwhelmed with lots of helpful advice and now I would like to share with the ones that are interested, how it went!

So in my original post I said how I wanted to get time off work to spend time with him but sadly I could not do this and instead I got permission from the post office if I can bring my son along on one of my deliveries which they said yes too. I talked to my son on Tuesday and asked if he would be interested in spending some time with me the next day and perhaps come to work with me. I said he could miss a day of school to spend time together. He was happy to spend time with me and he also didn’t seem to mind waking up early to come.

So yesterday came and we are both waking at around 6:30am we both get washed, have our breakfast and we get ready. We jump in the post van and we head to the post office. I noticed I had a bigger delivery than usual which was good because it meant I had more time to be with my son.

We begin driving and start our conversations small I ask how he has been doing at school and things like that (my son is 16). What I didn’t mention in my first post is that my son isn’t my biological son, his real dad left when he was 12 and his mother (my wife) died in 2011.

Eventually we came by a very convenient charity which was to help prevent violence against gay youths. I pulled over so that we could go check it out, I believed that if he saw me donating money and talking about how gay people should be able to be accepted it will help him think I’m open to gay people. I donated £10 and we got back in the post van and this is when he says “Tim, what made you do that?” I explained that I don’t think it’s right that gays are seen as different people and said that if my son was gay I would accept him and treat him no different. He went quiet and about 30 minutes later he says “Tim, I have something to tell you, I’m gay”.

I just stopped the van and began to hug him telling him that I’m proud that he has cane out and told him that he is very brave. We both did some crying and we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald’s.

I’m sorry if this has been a long post but I’m proud of my boy and I wanted to share this with you kind people that helped me. Thank you all!

TL;DR took my son to work with me, donated to a charity to help stop violence against gays, son came out as gay, we celebrated with ice cream and McDonald’s


Edit: WHAT THE FRICK!!! So many people replied my goodness I showed my son he was so happy honestly it made his day thank you all so much, I’m speechless, how can you amazing people exist, I won’t question it because it’s been truly amazing honestly can’t express this enough THANK YOU ALL!!!"

My brother is 22 years old but has the mental capacity of about 8. He has seizure disorder, autism, and a litany of other health problems due to brain damage at birth.  

He was playing something on his N64 I set up for him and I was downstairs playing on my phone. I was house-sitting (technically babysitting) for my parents. (Yes they are in the process of getting him in assisted living/home for adults with issues like this). 

Suddenly out of nowhere I hear a hideous scream, inhuman even. I race upstairs and my brother has the door shut and barred. Horrified, I pound on it and ask what happened and he keeps saying nothing over and over. I demand he open the door and he said no he's busy. He won't tell me what I heard was, or what happened. Freaked out, I race downstairs to the garage and grab my dad's stepladder and climb up to his window, and holy fuck. My brother is hunched over chewing on his fucking now-dead guinea pig. There's blood ***everywhere***. 

I immediately called 911, my parents, and his social worker and I don't know how to handle this. He's currently under observation at a mental hospital, my parents are pissed I ""let him"" do that, and that I called 911 over that, and I am not sure how to cope with this mentally. I mean, what the hell. 


**edit**: Lots of good advice from everyone that posted seriously. Thanks for the assurances. I will update after we find out what's going to happen to him. Sounds like he's in observation for 72 hours, so it might be a while before I have anything new to share.


***EDIT/UPDATE:*** My brother was released Friday afternoon into my parents custody, and they have already removed all traces of a pet and have temporarily removed his door. He will probably get the door back but not the lock. The eval we were given was really big and complicated but basically stated that it was probably a seizure that triggered a violent episode. If he exhibits any more violent or potentially violent behavior they requested we call 911 right away. We have a social worker assigned to us and they will be visiting my parents and brother on monday morning. Nothing else new to report, except for my reoccurring nightmares. I am also in the process of seeing a therapist and have an appointment scheduled for this wednesday afternoon for someone that specializes in family related trauma.

Thanks again to everyone and I appreciate your help!"

My Gramma and I are insanely close. She's called me every single day for as long as I can remember. Once I got a cellphone at 13, she and I spoke multiple times per day and saw each other frequently. I'm 28 now and she just turned 70 on the 12th. 

My aunt's work facility was infected with covid-19. It was in another building so she was very lax about everything. She lives in a duplex with my Gramma with my Gramma living above her. She didn't use any precautions. She went to the store often, she would go up and visit my grandma even though my Gramma begged her to stay downstairs until the pandemic was over. My dad even gave them both n95 masks which my aunt never used. My Gramma is a heavy lady, she's got diabetes and her breathing was already not great. 

My Gramma was admitted to the hospital last week and she spent her birthday in the ICU. She died twice last night and they did CPR and used a defibrillator to bring her back. Now she's on a ventilator and things aren't looking good. I didn't even get to say goodbye. I haven't actually seen my grandma since Christmas due to me working over time and then in March we went into lockdown and I didn't want to risk getting her sick. 

My aunt has been crying nonstop and feels horrible and wants me to call her but I have her number blocked. I don't want to talk to her. She's also sick with the virus and I wish it was her dying and not my Gramma. I fucking hate her and I don't care if she wants me to talk to her, I never want to see her again. My father and my brother think I'm cruel and that her guilt is heavy enough for them to forgive her but it's not for me... but I am starting to feel guilty as well. My aunt did everything with my grandma and really doesn't have any friends. Idk."

 I am not in jail yet and I am waiting to hear if I am being charged.

I know everyone was saying not to do it, get a lawyer and everything but honestly I am a good person who just made a bad decision. I could have kept on hiding it but eventually it would have caught up to me. Living everyday with that dirty secret not knowing if and when you will caught honestly was eating me alive in my mind. 

It was just a matter of time before I would have been found out.

For the last couple of months I was gambling every penny I had just to win it back... 

I went to seek help today and I will continue with trying to fix myself so I don’t make the same mistake again. 

The losing after the gambling is what made me wanna die. And it was a feeling in the moment, if any of you can understand that.

I will update as everything in this situation unfolds.

At uni years ago, I lived in a big house share at the top of the house. One night I was asleep and awoke to some noise coming into my room. It was the sound of one of my female flat mates that also lived on the top floor. She had just got home from a drunken night out. She was completely all over the place. She was whispering for me to wake up. I was still half asleep and expected her just to leave. Next thing I know I realised my blanket had been removed from on top of me. 

She had grabbed my penis and was attempting to give me a blow job. I pushed her away. She kept coming back and grabbing at my penis. She was quite forceful and aggressive and kept begging me to please let her suck me of. 

I was really grossed out by the situation. And by the fact that this girl always tried to give off an air of superiority of moral ethics over everyone else. And yet here she was trying to force herself on me sexually. I managed to get her off and out of my room. At which point a few minutes later I could hear her snoring loudly in her room which was across the hall. She snores extremely loudly. 

I never really thought about it much after. It was never mentioned. I was so embarrassed by what had happened. And I never knew whether she was too drunk to remember. Years have passed. We lost touch. She was very toxic and I distanced myself. Only to then discover she is now a leading female empowerment activist for refugees and minorities. And gives talks on all of this. It makes me sick to think of what she did to me. And here she is now talking out against the exact type of things she is guilty of trying to do herself. 

If a guy had done this to a girl at uni they would have been kicked out most likely. I can’t help but think if I had said anything no one would have believed me especially as it was a number of years ago now. But seeing her now trying to come across as this saviour of morality makes me feel nauseas. I feel frustrated that I still find it difficult to move on and just forget about it. I know if I ever confronted her maybe for some weird kind of closure or something, she would just deny it. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this and i think that’s why I’m writing. If I am over blowing feeling this way and I should just man up then please tell me. I just want to not feel such resentment as it’s bringing me down. But I don’t know how to.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: i really only expected a few replies, so this has overwhelmed me. I haven’t been able to thank everyone but I really appreciate all the replies. The funny thing is, this thread has been cathartic and almost helped to give me some kind of closure in a way which I never expected. Thanks so much for taking the time to reply."

Hello, everyone.

I am an older gentleman who lives alone in the Pacific Northwest. I am retired and as such, I have a lot of time on my hands. Ordinarily, I used my time to volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club and partake in some hobbies outside the home.

With Coronavirus causing my state to go into quarantine, I am forced to spend quite a few hours alone at home.

I am a widower of 9 years and my children and grandchildren live across state lines and are unable to visit.

To stave off the loneliness, I thought I may pick up a new hobby. I’ve been told by Caden, my grandson, that video games are an immersive experience these days (a far cry from when they started as “Pong” ha!)

I’d like to give it a whirl. I am looking for recommendations for video games that can be picked up by a novice easily. 

As I understand it, I can play these games on a personal computer or I can purchase a video game console. Is there any benefit to purchasing the console?

Thank you in advance,
Glenn"

He was walking strangely. I said hi to him and he responded in a weak voice that sounded like he was sick. I thought maybe he was just tired. He went in the bathroom and stayed there for a long time making no sound. I asked if he was ok and he mumbled something. Me and my mom were watching the news and he walks out of the bathroom asking what happened in that weak voice again. I asked him ""Is there something wrong with you?"" and he said yes. When I asked him what's wrong, he responded I don't know. Me and mom kept asking ""What's wrong, why are you acting like that? Is something hurting? Did something happen?"" And each time he kept responding ""I don't know."" My mom asked him how could he not know what's wrong and he bursted out crying ""I don't know!"" I sat by him on the couch and he wouldn't open his eyes. When I asked him if he was in pain he cried saying ""I don't know"" again. Then he went back to his room to sleep. Does anyone know what could be wrong with him? 

UPDATE: I called 911 and EMS came and did some tests on my dad. They said he seems to be healthy but should go to the hospital to make sure. He refused. Guess there isn't anything else I can do. Thankfully he doesn't seem to be having a stroke. He's walking and talking normally now. He said he took about 6 sleeping pills and a powerful muscle relaxer so I guess that could be it. Both my parents are really pissed at me for calling 911 but hey better to be safe than sorry! Thanks for all the responses. 

CLARIFICATION: I'm getting a lot of comments asking the same questions. My dad has severe insomnia that sometimes causes him to be up for several days. Even the strongest sleeping pills often don't help him. He was prescribed the sleeping pills and muscle relaxer. He didn't take them all at once but over the course of a day. I know my dad isn't suicidal or a drug abuser (except for this instance obviously). Ironically, he's very against any kind of drugs, including prescription, and I often have to force him to take his pills. He probably just had impaired judgement from sleep deprivation. Obviously still very stupid behavior I'll make sure never happens again. People keep saying that he could've had TIA and needs to go to the ER immediately, but since he refuses to go I don't think there's anything I can do. I'll no longer be hesitant to call 911 if something like this ever happens again, but beyond that my hands are tied. I'll be on the lookout for symptoms of a stroke, Alzheimer's, low blood sugar, or any strange behavior from him. Thankfully he's acting completely normal now. Thanks for all the helpful comments and concern. "

I bought some snacks, drinks and expected a cool night with friends - maybe watch a movie, play some video games or just talk to each other.
And so they come to my house, things are fine, and like an hour passes.
I have to go downstairs to the kitchen ( we live in a two-floor house) and help my mom with something. I tell them that I'm gonna be back in like 10-15 minutes.
Later when I come upstairs they're gone. All but one had left, and he tells me that they left because ""they were bored, and had nothing to do here"".
Not only did they leave, but they decided to drive around and hang out in their cars. Basically 5 people split it 2 cars was more interesting and fun for my friends than staying at my house with me. And they didn't even bother to tell me they were leaving.
I feel awful, and none of them have contacted me after that. 
They've also hung out in their cars once or twice after that and didn't even bother inviting me. 
I'm pretty sure my friendship with them is done for, and I don't know what to do. They are the only friends I have. 

P.s. - If you're wondering about what happened to the guy that decided to stay - I told him to leave as well, because I was basically at the brink of tears, and didn't want anyone around me.
He is still the only one of them that occasionally messages me to see how I'm doing.

Edit: Thank you all for the support you've given me! It has made me feel way much better and less lonely, and I really appreciate it! 
I have decided to let go of the ""friendship"" I had with them. It was hard for me to make that decision, because as I said they're all I have, and I was just too afraid to be left alone - but still your comments helped me gain the courage to do what's needed, so once again thank you!
If they do reach out to me and try to fix things up though, I might give them a second chance - but it really depends on what they will say. And even if I do forgive them, I will not tolerate such things anymore - if it happens again it would definitely be the end.
I will keep in touch with the guy that stayed, and I truly hope to make some new friends as well. 
Thank you all for caring, and for giving me some of your time! I wish you all to be happy and well!"

Now I'm alone, dropped out of university and not sure where to go. How do I set up a new life in a different state and start over? It happened 2 months ago and I'm finally speaking about it. Usually I'd be too shy to write Reddit posts because I was highly doubtful that I would get any support, let alone sympathy. I accept that I need help and I'm not okay and it's okay not to be okay. I'm hurting. I'm hurting and alone and scared. I couldn't focus in school knowing I'm the only one left alone now. I only had my mother and my older brother. My dad left us when I was born. This does effect me but I grew up strong with dreams  of a better life and that just kept me going.

 My situation growing up was inevitable but my future was my decision. My family kept me going through it all. I live in Southern California and was attending school not far reach from my family. However, two months ago.. there was a horrible break-in while I was away (Police said). I assume because my family was home.. they thought the best way to get rid of evidence was to set my house ablaze.. I'm truly.. I'm truly devastated.


 They didn't live in the best area since we all grew up poor and I can't help but feel guilty that I wasn't there to save them. They patiently waited for me to succeed so that when I started my career, I can take them with me and away from the hell we lived in. I eventually stopped going to school and would have panic attacks at my part-time job. I was in a month to month where I was staying while I went to Uni but since I was already living basically on the financial edge (I didn't take any loans out for school) I ended up relinquishing my spot there as well.

  Now, I'm staying with my cousin but living conditions are horrible. He's the messiest, sleaziest person I have ever met but it's the only shelter I have. I only have one uncle and one aunt but they didn't like my mom so they resent me regardless of the situation. There's roaches and ants.. mold on the wall and I just don't feel safe as a woman in this neighborhood let alone at home. Well.. I guess place. I dont have a home anymore.


 I need advice on how I can start over in another state away from this hell. It's hard for me to go outside after the trauma. I don't sleep and when I do I wake up screaming. I panic when I hear leaves go by outside of the apartment and I'm losing it. Too many memories here. I plan to continue my educational endeavors and work to at least get a room somewhere, I'm just unsure how to start.

I don't know where to look.. I don't know who to trust or who to talk to. I'm trying to stay calm and collect myself but the lack of sleep is making me hallucinate. Please help. 

About me: I was born in Southern California but was raised in NorCal/Denmark for most of my life. I'm a female, 23 years old and am of Asian descent. I was attending UCLA. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your loving support. I want to let you know that I am reading I'm just not sure what to say. I’m overwhelmed with happiness right now.  You all have given me hope."

Last pay period my check was short two hours, it was the first time my check had ever been short. I confronted her and told her, my hours were two hours more than what she had added up on the time card. I showed her how I figured my hours and she told me that she just turned everything into decimals and added them up, like how the pay company told her to do it. However, for 7 hours 30 minutes, she figured 7.3 instead of 7.5. I tried to explain the simple math behind how her figuration was wrong but she assured me she was correct and that she would even ask the pay roll company ""PayChex"" what was correct. She told me, they told her she was correct. On my time card this pay period I wrote 7.5 for 7 days (52.5) and she said I was doing it wrong and that it needed to be 7.3 for 7 days (51.1). She said she would call again and ask them when she called in pay roll. She again stated that they told her .30 was the correct way to write half an hour in decimal form. So I called ""PayChex"" myself after work and they said they highly doubted anyone in their company told her that, and that .50 was in fact the correct decimal. My boss is now angry with me, claiming that I'VE been the one swindling money and hours from HER.

How do I convincingly lie to my family about how I got it? Should I even lie about it? 18 year old high school senior here. This has been bothering me ever since I realized high school will be over in just a little over a semester.

Throughout high school, I've just been an average kid (on the surface). B student, doing the bare minimum expected of me, etc. Nothing astounding or terrible and I'm just trying to get through high school.

When I turned 16, I started working part time for my aunt at her restaurant just as a way to get some spending money for gas and going to high school football games with friends. She didn't pay me conventionally. I have a PayPal through which she would pay me. I was under 18 at the time so the account is in my mom's name, but she doesn't have the password nor any real reason (or so she thinks at least, she's probably forgotten about the account entirely at this point) to monitor it. Also, the account has my email and phone number. Point is, she has no access to the account. (This is probably relevant because it's what I used to acquire my money in the second half of this post.)

I made enough money for gas and the occasional ball game, but not much more than that. When I wanted to upgrade my computer, I began thinking of ways to make some extra cash. My aunt refused to give me a raise and my mom wouldn't let me look for a new job because she didn't want me to ""abandon my aunt"" for another business, why don't you just stop spending your money elsewhere, etc.

Drawing has always been a hobby and a passion of mine. I've been drawing since I was 9 or 10 and I'd say I'm pretty decent at it. So naturally, while brainstorming side-job ideas, I thought of starting an art commission business.

For the first few months, business wasn't booming. I had told all of my friends and family about it and posted it on my private social media. A few of my relatives commissioned art from me, but in hindsight it was almost certainly out of pity for my lack of business or maybe my mom told them to.

I eventually began posting about my art commissions on public media such as Instagram, Reddit (the account is long gone by now, don't ask.), and...the place where I struck gold...4chan.

The drought kept up for another month until someone replied to me on a /b/ art thread claiming to be interested in a commission. We exchanged Kiks and started talking. When he told me what he wanted me to draw, I found it repulsive and came up with an excuse, saying I don't have experience drawing what he wanted and thanking him for the offer. That was when he offered double the amount of money I initially asked for, offering me a whole 40 bucks.

$40 isn't a lot, but as I was younger, it was about equal to a day at work. So on the one hand, $40. On the other, I did not want to nor did I have any experience in drawing furry porn.

To summarize the next few days, much to my surprise, the guy liked my work and said his friends did too. He invited me to a Discord server full of people like him, and from there I joined other servers and forums and message boards dedicated to ""that kind of art."" From then on, the commissions started rolling in, first slowly, then steadily. Once both demand and my skill in drawing that kind of art increased, I started buffing up my prices.

Let me tell you. those sick bastards will pay a lot. a LOT. for those commissions. No shit, the highest commission I ever charged was for $350, and the dude paid it in full. The average price of a commission was around \~$75-100, with the price increasing for more demanding artwork, technically demanding or mentally demanding. (I didn't tell them about the mentally demanding part, I had to keep up a reputation by pretending to be one of them. Easily the worst part of the job.)

You may be wondering, why did I continue doing this after I got enough money for that computer upgrade? Well, I was 16-18 and making more money than my previous self could've ever imagined making. Of course I continued the commissions. Besides, after drawing your 50th naked anthropomorphic ""fursona"" (these guys' furry alter egos), you start to get pretty desensitized towards it.

After drawing your 150th, or your 200th, however, starts to become a little dehumanizing and mid-life crisis (early-life crisis?) inducing. I finally made the revelation earlier this year that I just can't do this forever. Not only would it probably not be a very secure job forever, but it made me progressively more disgusted by myself.

Aaaanyway, in the past few years, I've managed to rack up just under $22,000 in furry art commissions. I'm ready to forget about my past, go to art school, study graphic design, and make a living as an artist in a legitimate way rather than a repugnant way.

My parents aren't rich, but they are just a little on the wealthy side. They and I have discussed the expenses of college in the past and they have told me that if I were to continue living at home, attend a certain art school which is relatively close to home (and is relatively inexpensive), and get as much financial aide and scholarships as I could, they would be able to cover most of the expenses, but I would probably need a loan of $25,000-30,000 to cover the rest. Assuming I can get accepted into the college (which I think I easily can), with my savings and their savings, and a little bit of being economic, I believe I would be able to attend all 4 years without having to get a loan at all. My main idea was to tell them I won the lottery, but...I don't know. I hate lying and I've been hiding this from them for years. I feel like i just need to come clean with them about it. I have absolutely no idea how they would react.

All that to ask this. What is the best way to go about this? Should I go through with lying to them? What would be the most believable way to lie to them while keeping their trust and support?

TL;DR: Made bank drawing furry porn in high school. Parents don't know about the money but I want to use it for college. What do?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses. Currently, my favorite idea is the middle ground of telling them about how I got the money from my commissions while also not going into the detail of my art. I would play it off as if it was a surprise and that's why I didn't tell them earlier. Another idea I like is investing it and getting a loan. Maybe I'll do one or both of these, or perhaps neither. I haven't fully decided yet.

To those who wish to see my art (furry or otherwise), and to those who say they wish to commission art from me, I'm going to have to regretfully decline your request. I've said too much here, to show my art or give my contact information for a commission would possibly be too identifying. For the same reason, I don't want to reveal the servers or forums I was formerly active on. Maybe I'm being paranoid, but I just want to be careful. Sorry about that. If you're looking to get into the furry art industry, 4chan art request threads may be your gateway if you're persistent and eventually get lucky.

EDIT 2: Don't worry guys, I will talk to an accountant and pay my taxes. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. That will be my first priority once I talk to my parents."

That was almost 2 months ago So my friend had a little girl named Mariana. She doesn’t know who the father is, and whatever. High key she’s always been kind of a shit mom - neglectful and short tempered. But I always thought she loved Mariana

I babysat for Mariana a bit here and there but I wasn’t the only sitter. I came to really like this kid. 

She’s now 4. 

Ever since January my friend was bragging about her new boyfriend in Atlanta. Late April she messaged me and said “hey, my sitter bailed, can you watch Mary (our nickname for Mariana) from friday to Monday (April 27-30)? I’m going to Atlanta to meet my boyfriend and I can’t bring her.” 

I agreed to babysit. She told the school and everything. 

So Friday morning she dropped off a bunch of clothes and a stuffy at my apartment. In hindsight she left way more clothes than was normal, but I didn’t think anything of it. Then she left to catch her plane. 

I went and picked up Mariana from school, and took her home (for the record I don’t work, I receive compensation and disability from a work injury that left me with a bad knee). I took her to the park across the street from my building and played with her until dinner time, we cooked dinner together, we cleaned up, watched a movie, and then I read her stories (on my phone, the mother didn’t have books and never read to her). I got her changed and put her to bed on the couch, and I went to sleep. We had a good weekend, we went to the library Saturday for half the day and played at the park, and Sunday was kind of a lazy cuddle day - we did some crafts, put on a movie, and napped all day. 

Monday after school the mom was supposed to have come to gotten Mariana by 5. She didn’t show. I spammed her phone with calls and texts and got no answer. 

I didn’t know what to do so I just kept doing what I was doing. Tuesday, there was still no contact. Mariana was starting to get upset and asked where mommy was. 

Wednesday I went to my friend’s house but no one home. I contacted all of our mutual friends but still nothing. 

Wednesday night was hard. Mariana had a really bad tantrum, crying and screaming for her mommy. It was so bad she didn’t sleep and I had to tell her school she wouldn’t be in. The school, for the record, wasn’t asking questions yet. 

Finally I got her to calm down. I told her her mommy got a lil lost on her trip but until she came home I’d take care of her. 

She started to have nightmares about being abandoned and became anxious and clingy. After a week of being woken up by her screaming through the night, I let her sleep with me, which helped tremendously. 

So that lasted 5 days until I bought her a little futon and put it beside my bed, so if she wakes up she can see that I’m still right beside her. 

When she was delivered to me in April, her clothes smelled iffy, her shoes had holes in the soles and were too small, and I found out she needs glasses. I bought her a whole new wardrobe, new shoes, I taught her how to cook and bake and we’re learning guitar for kids. 

She’s healthier, she looks better (before she looked tired all the time and seemed to just be... not well nourished). She hadn’t touched any soda since she’s been in my care and she eats regular healthy meals.

But we ran into an issue. I took her to get glasses, and the eye doctor said I couldn’t sign for her or make appointments for her since I wasn’t her legal guardian. The school began asking “where is your friend?” And I have no idea. 

I told my mom that I would be going to the police and asking them what to do, but what she told me made me stop.... now it’s been 2 weeks and I know I can’t just keep her but... my mom told me if I went to the police I wouldn’t be able to keep her. They’d take her away and try to find the mom or give her to another relative of hers - Mariana would likely go to my friend’s mom who used to beat her. 

When I was getting ready to go with Mariana to the police station I burst into tears and I hugged her and I told her I loved her and she said “I wuv you too daddy” without any prompting or that word ever being said around her. 

I don’t want to lose her... out of everyone in her life I’m the only one who wanted her. I love her. I want her. 

Edit: just to clarify, Mariana’s grandmother and uncle both know I have her. They seem to know where the mother is but they won’t say anything. They don’t care that I’m taking care of her and they have never requested or demanded her. They don’t want her.

What do I do? Can I be allowed to adopt her based on the grounds that I’ve been looking after her this long? Or will they take her away? 

Edit 2: I’ve decided that I have to do the right thing. I’m going to call the grandmother Monday morning and tell her I want custody. And then no matter what, I’ll call CPS, and apply for emergency custody. I’m not ready to say goodbye. I’m on the brink of a panic attack just thinking of it, I feel sick and I’m sweating. But.... we have laws for a reason, and if I circumvent them to protect Mariana other people can do it to hurt kids. 

I’m going to wait until Monday. Tomorrow I’m going to give Mariana the best night of her life. Anything she wants to do or wants to have is hers. 

Wish me luck.

Edit 3: I sought out help from r/legaladvice but I don’t think they understand what I’m trying to figure out since almost all of their comments are about race. But yeah, I will reach out to CPS and explain that I have spent months trying to get in touch with Mariana’s legal guardian, that I have been her surrogate parent since April, and that Mariana had benefited from my care. I’ll try to explain that I would like to be granted temporary custody until this is figured out since separating us could be traumatizing for Mariana. Thank you all for your advice and kind comments. 

Edit 4: since it seemed to upset a lot of people I deleted some information about how no one knows Mariana’s cultural identity. It’s not really relevant anyways as my concerns that culture could influence CPS’s decisions is apparently unfounded. I’m happy that CPS doesn’t see colour or culture but I hope that in doing so, they don’t mistakenly put children in the homes of people who are disrespectful towards their heritage. 

Edit 5: I just got off the phone with Mariana’s grandmother. It didn’t go well. She was quite offended when I said I had already called CPS, and she was even more offended that I want to adopt Mariana. She insinuated that I am trying to hurt the mother because I’m jealous that she won’t sleep with me. While Mariana’s mother is a pretty woman, our personalities are at conflict and despite my crippling loneliness I am not interested in engaging in those activities with her. The exchange became heated as she focused on my weight and lack of sexual prowess and I focused on Mariana’s wellbeing and my desire to give her a good home. 

I’ll make a new update post once everything has settled down. CPS should have someone here by 4:30. 

Edit 6: I can’t really message 200 people so I’ll just post this here and whoever sees it sees it. https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8uljpa/in_april_a_friend_dropped_her_daughter_off_with/"

I’ve had 7 hours of sleep in days since he doesn’t stop screaming, I am not allowed to take his controller since we have 2 of them. It’s constant and he literally burst into tears at times for losing a game of madden, I recently just woke up from one of his screaming fits that has lasted about 45 mins so far. 

He doesn’t stop nor does he care about others. He’s been admitted to the insane asylum once for putting a knife to his throat when my mom took his phone after he wouldn’t clean his room. He put a knife to his throat since he wouldn’t clean his room, and they released him the same night. He’s just not ok in a good mental state. When his best friend wrote him a 10 paragraph wall of text and he judged responded with “ok idc”. 

He hasn’t always been like this and he has had huge personality changes which have scared tf out of me. My biological father keeps telling me it isn’t a big deal since he’s normal. Clearly he isn’t normal. It should also be noted he best my knee into a swollen mess when I took his bike down the street I buy me and him ice cream, he told me I never got permission to use his bike. 

The things I’ve done to him have all been in self defense and I get in trouble most of the time. He told the driver of the Ambulance that I told him to do it and I am always trying to make him fail in life. He’s literally insane"

I recently got a friend request from my 5th-grade parent's teacher. I am 30 now. She sent me some happy message with excitement and ""hugs, hugs, hugs!"", and it's left me very confused. 

This woman was an absolute monster to me when I was in her class. She would go out of her way to humiliate me or punish me for things that I had nothing to do with. During this time my mother was getting treated for cancer and had to get surgery, my father fell back into alcoholism, and my parents marriage was falling apart. 

Every day I dreaded going to class. Literally have panic attacks. She would single me out and look for things to put me down for. I'd never screamed at a teacher in my life, but I lost it on her when I had to leave early to go to the hospital for my mom and walked in to get my things during break, which she didn't allow. She immediately screamed at me, started writing up a detention slip, kept screaming, and I snapped and lost it, she kept yelling at me and putting me down even after I explained I was going to the hospital. Or when I was having anxiety over having a tooth pulled and when my dad came to pick me up, she jokingly/menacingly yelled ""THEY'RE GOING TO RIP ALL YOUR TEETH OUT!"". And that's just some of the things she did. 

She was literally the reason I told my parents that I refused to ever go to a christian or religiously based school again, and it was living hell for the year I had her. Now she thinks we're friends?

I don't want to attack her, but I am tempted to at least confront her on it, say I forgive her, and move on. Shouldn't an ass hole be held accountable? Or is there a statute of limitations over childhood trauma?"

So. Yeah. My girlfriend walked out on us a month ago. She literally packed her shit and went while I was at work, just left behind a note saying she'd been cheating for a year and had moved across the country to be with the new dude. The relationship wasn't perfect and we certainly had some major problems but I didn't see this coming at all. I mostly blame myself. 

Our kid is 4. Thus far I've been telling him that mummy has just gone away to stay with a friend for a little while. But he keeps asking when she's coming back, or talking about things we can do when she gets back. He has nightmares 1-2 times a week and always wakes up crying for her. He rejects me on those nights because he wants mummy and her special song to soothe him and it isn't the same when I sing it. Twice he has gotten so worked up following a nightmare and asking for her that he's thrown up. There are days where he will literally sit for hours in our window watching our building's car park waiting for her to pull in. It's absolutely destroying me. 

I don't know how to tell him she isn't coming back without absolutely destroying his entire world. I've managed to get in contact with her three times since she left, and all three times I've begged her to at least call him or write him letters I can read to him or *something*, but she doesn't want to know. She says she isn't ready to give up her dreams yet in the way having a kid forces her to, that she's too young for this (even though I'm 4 years younger than her) and that she hates how she ruined her life and wants a clean slate.

So I(M) just got engaged to my girlfriend of almost 5 years.

Bit of a backstory, I have a brother (2 years older than me) that suffers with severe cerebral palsy due to complications at birth that resulted in a hemispherectomy procedure (where half the brain is removed). He has about the mental age of a toddler, but is none the wiser and is happier than the average person. He requires 24/7 care from my parents and additional support. No fault of his own, he is very vocal and loud. My parents life revolve around him 360 degrees and I always come 2nd. Fair enough.

My problem here started when I told my mother about wanting to ask my girlfriend to marry me and her first response was “Will the venue be disable accessible?” No congratulations, no tears, just concern about my brothers access.

After proposing, the worries started to come. If we invite my parents and brother to the wedding, is the wedding going to revolve around my brother and his comfort and are they going to completely ignore me?

The selfish part of me wants to invite them bar my brother because I don’t want to be sidelined on such an important day, if not the most important day of my life. (side note: they never attended my University graduation even though I asked months in advance and the excuse was they had to look after my brother).

I’ve came to the conclusion that I do not want my brother there anyway due to his vocal nature; he would be a very big distraction during such an intimate moment. I love my brother, it’s not personal, I just don’t want to be thinking about that during our special day. Plus he would be none the wiser to his surroundings.

**My question here is**: how could I possible approach my parents about this issue without offending them?

My fiancé has concerns that when I talk to my parents, it will feel like this is coming from her and not me, possibly making her out to be the bad guy when this is 100% my worries.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit:** Thank you to all that replied, I will respond to each tomorrow but for now, I feel the need to clarify a few details:

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance and I planned on having a destination wedding with only us and a friend to officiate obviously not including witnesses but since COVID-19, travelling abroad just isnt possible to even plan as of now.

We have resorted to planning an inland wedding with a max capacity at the ceremony of 12 people. It is a very small gathering for us as we have an intamate circle of friends and family despite having extended family. My brothers presence would duly be recognised due to the small scale of the wedding.

My brother is also wheelchair bound and has many physical restrictions and due to this, finding a venue that isn't a social club just isnt possible. My parents have access to additional care, however, a respite home is out of the question due to abuse taking place in those institutions."

My sister is an 8th grader in middle school. Her bus arrives for school at 8:30 every morning. My mom leaves at 7:30 A.M. to go to work and I leave at 8:00 A.M. to go to college. We set countless alarms for her to wake up to, and we try to wake her up before we leave. My mother sets an alarm in her room and three alarms on my sisters phone. I am getting ready to leave when the first alarm goes off. My sister always walks to my mothers room, which is a good 20-30 feet away from her own,turns off the alarm and cozies up in her own bed. She has missed consecutive whole weeks of school, and I estimate she's missed about two to three weeks per nine weeks. My mom just got a new job after working ten years for the same company, she's on a 1 year probation period where the slightest mistake can get her terminated. My sister has missed so many days of school that my mother could possibly be fined or arrested. All my sister has to do is wake up, get dressed and catch the school bus, but she is too lazy to get up. We try finding alternatives for if she misses the bus, such as taking the city bus, but she is too spoiled to try and learn. Everytime I try to show her the route, she defies me and lashes out.


I'm fucking sick of her, she talks back to our mom who tries to be gentle and calm with her, and she has the biggest fits over the slightest things. Our father travels around the country either working for a short period or sitting in jail. My sister is so unbelievably spoiled and she doesn't understand the consequences her actions have. She does awful in school, and my mother tries to punish her, taking her phone away, taking the TV cord, etc. But she either finds some way around her punishment, or she throws a fit. The only punishment she doesn't recieve is a spanking.


 Today was the last straw, I had food poisoning, so I was able to stay home. I made sure to wake her up and then I got caught up for about ten minutes in the bathroom. After getting off the toilet, I walk to her room to see her wrapped up under her covers. After missing a whole week of school for a ""leg injury"", she didn't get up today because she was ""too sleepy"". It would be one thing if she was stressed or overworked, but she clearly isn't, she never studies, does her homework, and she has an unhealthy obsession with discord (she doesn't even play games, she is just obsessed with whatever goes on in there). I immediately call my mom, who tearfully tries to plead with my sister to get up. All my sister responds with is a faint ""i'm sleepy"". She hands the phone back to me. I hear my mom sobbing over the phone, the last time I heard her cry was in 2007 when she broke up with my dad. I snapped and ripped the covers off my sisters bed and threw her in the shower and turned it on. I don't have a drivers license so I had to call an uber for her and she's currently off to school. 


My mom can't pay for an uber everytime she wakes up late, and I had to use my scholarship money to pay for this. With how bad my sister does in school she might get held back. When I was in middle school, on top of having to wake myself up, I had to wake up a good hour before 8:00 A.M. if I wanted to make it to school and socialize with my friends before class started. It was a good 50 minute walk every weekday for three years, and if I didn't want to walk I had to wake up extra early, around 5:00 a.m, if I wanted my mom to drive me there. My sister is privellaged enough to get a school bus to come to our house which is outside the zone for the school she is going to, and she doesn't utilize it. If my mom were to get arrested or fined for my sisters' truancy she could lose her job, which is ridiculous. If my sister can make it past 8th grade, she will be in high school, and will need to wake up earlier than me and my mom, so we'll be home to wake her up. But with how things are going, I'm afraid she'll either be held back, or my mom might lose her job. At the very least, is there any way to absolve my mother of any consequences that are related to my sister's truancy?

EDIT: I'm her brother

EDIT 2: Thank you all for your responses. Before I made this thread I suggested that my mom schedule an appointment with a therapist. We got an appointed scheduled with a doctor on the 6th that will suggest if my sister needs therapy or not. All of your responses have been extremely helpful. I was given a link to an article I shared with my sister to read and I sent the CINS/PINS Pdf to my mom so she could read it. I'm currently waiting for a response.

EDIT 3: I know it seems like i'm making excuses for some of the answers in the comment, but you have to understand that my mom has financially and emotionally supported two children by herself over the past 18 years. We have tried being aggressive with my sister, even to the point of just throwing her outside her room. She will go limp and completely refuse all compliance. We have taken every source of entertainment out of her room, it enables her to think it's fine to miss school as long as she loses something. Some of these options do not work for how stuborn she is. She is a 14 year old, and has reached a point in her maturity where she could be considered a young woman. My mother seriously works her hardest to try to get through to my sister, she does not deserve to get her home, job, and life stripped from her over the actions of a stubborn 14 year old not going to school.


EDIT 4: Probation doesn't mean my mom got in trouble with the law or her work, she's never been arrested in her life or faced a criminal charge. It just means she's new at work and any mistake could cost her job."

She’s just acting as if everything is normal. Her mum came and took her to deliver her parcels so I’m now stuck in her room with her dad walking around the house. 

I am unable to move without him knowing i’m here. She should be home in half an hour with her mum. I have my shoes on me.

Any advice?


Edit: they do not know we are in a relationship and would flip if they found out, I’ve been going to her house for a while with her parents there under the impression that we’re just friends. Her Dad came home to the blinds closed and assumed she slept in.


Edit 2: She does have very large windows. I could definitely climb out of them but I’m worried about the obvious noise from jumping


Update: I think he’s gone to sleep. He’ll wake up when she comes home soon though, if I want to sneak past him it’ll have to be in the next 5 minutes I think.

I’m just waiting it out until she gets back now.

Update:  Still here... they’ll be having food soon. I think they’ll hear me walking down the stairs still. She is back home and in the room with me now


I’M OUT

Okay bold move. We tried to synchronise our steps towards the door. She opened it pretending I had just come round to collect something and we had a little chat to play along. She’s gone to have tea, I’ll let you know if I’m in the clear or not!


Final update: they didn’t question anything, we’re all good. Thanks for your suggestions!"

&amp;#x200B;

Lets get straight to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

I left an anonymous note in the box of my school counselor. The counselor had a ""talk"" with all five people involved (rapist and watchers) and they denied everything, and said whoever put that note in his box was lying. There was technically no proof of it actually happening, to the counselor at least, so they won't take further action until real proof is given to him and the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that M17 took a flash photo, like I thought. It spread around most of the school but no one so far has reported it to the faculty or police. I've been getting harassed for the past few days now, with people showing me the photo asking ""is this you?""

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too scared to show the photo to the faculty, because it technically doesn't show my rapist's full face or my full face so they *could* just say its unreliable evidence.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the police station yesterday, and reported the crime. No one was dumb enough to actually send me the photo, so I just told the police the names of everyone involved and there is evidence on their phones. I was told they would look into it. Hopefully my rapist and the four onlookers get arrested.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I cannot thank you all enough for the overwhelming support. It made my days a little bit better :)"

She also owns a specialty cake business on the side and is continuing to make cakes without disclosing her current positive status. I’m bound by HIPAA and can not disclose her health information, although she was not a patient in our hospital. We were told by administration. She’s going to get people sick. She makes cakes from home where her boyfriend (who is also positive) lives, and there is no possible way the cakes she is making are not contaminated. What can I do? Anything?

Small update: Wow. Thank you all so much for reaching out with your advice! I feel much less crazy with all the support this has gotten. I got in touch with my local health services department and anonymously brought up the complaint. They took down a callback number for me (not my number, but a phone I have access to) and said they will call me back at some point today. I have very little faith in our local police so I’m hoping this pans out.

I’d also like to say that this is more than just her making cakes while sick. She runs the business out of her home, where people come in and pick them up. As far as I know, she is not doing delivery right now. She interacts with these customers extensively, and even did a photo shoot with a 1 year old and the birthday cake she made for him over the weekend. This isn’t a professionally run kitchen with mandatory precautions put in place. Right now, it’s a really dangerous operation. 

Will do a final update hopefully later today with more information.


UPDATE: I really wish I had a better update for you guys. I got bounced around between 4 different agencies and departments and sat on hold for hours just to leave a message for the final person I was redirected to. I called the local PD and they took down a report, but didn’t seem all too concerned with it. Thankfully, I’m not the only person with this information who is outraged and pledged to do something about it. Many of my coworkers are supposedly doing something about this as well. Although I’m not throwing in the towel. I’ll talk to my administrator and coworkers about this when I work tomorrow, and will absolutely tell you all the SECOND I have some solid information or hear back from any of the people I left messages for. Thank you all for your support and concern! It’s nice to see people thinking selflessly of the safety of complete strangers."

To start off, I’m 25 and my brother is 20. Our dad passed away a year ago and my brother had a really hard time with it. He eventually withdrew from college and moved back home to get his head straightened out. I was home visiting this weekend and everything seemed normal. We hung out, went out to lunch, my brother and I saw a movie together, we caught up, the usual family stuff. My mom converted my old bedroom into a home office, so I was sleeping in the guest room in the basement.

Last night, after everyone went to bed, I snuck out back and blazed up. Don’t judge me. I’m not a pothead, but it helps me to relax sometimes. I came inside, watched tv, and around midnight was stupidly hungry so I went to the kitchen to get a snack.

While I was in the kitchen, I thought I heard someone yell something upstairs but it was muffled. I went to the base of the stairs and listened and I heard was I’m positive were sex noises from upstairs. I didn’t think my mom or bro was seeing anyone and I definitely didn’t thin anyone came to the house after I went downstairs. I was mostly just curious so I crept up the stairs a little and I could hear one of the voices was my mom for sure. I assumed it was just a booty call and maybe someone snuck in while I was downstairs. I went back to the kitchen, warmed up some pizza in the toaster oven and was eating it at the counter when I heard a door open and close upstairs, followed by footsteps, and then another door closing. Again, curious, so I went upstairs and went to my bro’s room to see if he was awake and knew what was going on. His light was on so I knocked lightly and he answered the door in boxers and looking sweaty. He sort of jumped when he saw it was me, like he wasn’t expecting it. He asked what’s up and I said I thought I heard some noises up here and wondered if he had too. He got super sketchy and blushed and said he hadn’t heard anything. I was super suspicious now and also felt super awkward bc it sorta seemed like maybe he had been involved in making those noises. I felt really embarrassed and weird and I basically gtfo of there and went downstairs.

I couldn’t sleep that night and today at breakfast things were way awkward with me and him and mom. Maybe I’m being paranoid, I was smoking last night, but it feels like maybe they’re having sex and I caught them. I don’t know if I’m crazy and there’s another explanation or if I should say something. Part of me thinks if they are doing it they’re both adults, but idk, it’s got a major squick factor to it and I’m sorta at a loss. Do folks think I’m just being paranoid and, if not, should I say something?

Edit: I should have mentioned that I’m a female. Dunno that it makes a huge difference but Some people assumed I was a guy.

[UPDATE]


Still figuring out what comes next, but I got so much advice and so many responses last time I wanted to update you all. Last night, I pretended that I was going out for dinner and drinks with friends and said I wouldn’t be home until late. I drove around the block, parked, and snuck back into the basement. And then I waited and listened.

I heard the tv on and my mom and bro talking. I couldn’t really make out what they were saying. Around 9 o’clock they went upstairs. Once I was sure they were both upstairs I snuck up and listened at the base of the stairs (around the corner from the bottom so no one would see me). I felt like a nut but I haven’t been able to stop thinking about all the what ifs. I heard voices from my mom’s room; again too soft to make out. After maybe 20 mins I heard a moan. I crept up the stairs and when I was at the top I could hear what were distinctly sex noises from moms room.

I crept down the hall to see if my bro was in his room, pushed the door open, and stuck my head in. At this point, I didn’t care if he asked me what I was doing home, I figured if he was in there I’d just tell him I came home early and wanted to hang out or something. But it didn’t really matter. It was empty.

I went back down the hall and listened at mom’s door. It was mostly quiet, the sound of the bed, a few grunts, but I distinctly heard mom saying oh fuck a few times. After a few minutes they clearly had climaxed, somewhat loudly, and the noises stopped and I heard my brother’s voice. He said he was going to take a quick shower. Then mom said she’d join him.

I was and am in a daze. I don’t think there’s any doubt that they are having sex. I went back to the basement and I’ve been lying here thinking for the last few hours. I haven’t said anything to either of them. Part of me wants to burst in on them, part of me wants to confront my bro, I don’t really want to talk to my mom.

It’s a really weird position to be in. I’m still sorting through all the thoughts I have. It’s a lot of different feelings all at once. It’s hard to explain."

So the place we went to is a little office inside a drug store so I ended up telling my mom she didn’t need to come in. She told me she wanted to and to call her in when they start. But as soon as the ladies saw my mother walk away from me to browse the store they began my scan and did it in a minute 45 seconds. 

Then they called in my mom and talked to her about payment stuff. So in the end it worked out. I want to thank the dental ladies for being so awesome!!"

I’m just living like any other day I used to have except walking to classes. I’m just at my laptop the whole day doing work and then watching anime, then playing some animal crossing.

But when I tell my friends that I’m enjoying quarantine, they call me a horrible person and that people are dying. Of course I know people are dying, but I was simply telling them that I’m enjoying this lifestyle of being in my room all day. So after they tell me that I just decide to shut up and listen to them complain that they want quarantine to end so that they can go back to college and party with their college friends. .

I’ve told him it’s a turn off and he won’t stop. Help. RESOLVED

This is my first post, so sorry abt formatting, on mobile.
So I (20 F) and my boyfriend (28 m) just finished game of thrones, we got really into it and binged it in a month, but my boyfriend has randomly started calling my cootchie Cersei and now it’s all the time. Is Cersei hungry for the D, how is Cersei today, I’m gonna f$ck Cersei later. And he does it everywhere. Yesterday we were at the grocery store and he said out loud that he was gonna “play with Cersei when we get home.” I find it to be a major turn off and have told him that but he won’t stop doing it. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I have this feeling he’s gonna rename it after whatever show we get into next. How to I get him to stop? I’ve tried calling his d!!k Tyrian and he didn’t care. —Cersei is the evil queen and Tyrian is a dwarf in case you haven’t watched game of thrones—

Edit: wow I wasn’t expecting this to blow up so much, in trying to read all the comments and reply to as many as I can. Basically what I understand is that I need to stop the sex, have a serious conversation with him, and somehow make him less old.

Update: thanks for all of the advice. I sat him down when he got home and I had a serious conversation with him about boundaries and what exactly I didn’t like about it. He did agree to stop but I expect him to slip up a few times since he’s gotten in the habit of doing it. All in all everything worked out.

Edit: let me make this very clear, he didn’t go after a 17 year old. We worked together and my manager was a lesbian who had the hots for me, so she would ask him leading questions, I.e. would you bend her over and slap her ass, don’t you think those titties are juicy, ect. Then she’d relay what he’d said to me. Basically living vicariously through us. I went after him, not the other way around. It was supposed to be a one and done, obviously that’s not how it happened."

It's worth noting that I'm more than twice her age; and I'm as confused as you probably are disgusted at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to family circumstances, I'm occasionally spending time with a seemingly normal 11yo girl, a very distant relative of mine. Her and her mother are staying in the house temporarily.  Girl obviously developed a crush on me. Keeps staring at me, seeks any excuse to hug me, etc.... No big deal, I thought it was cute at first.

&amp;#x200B;

It got weird a few nights ago. We were sitting on the couch, she's watching cartoons, I'm messing with my phone. Out of nowhere she sits in my lap, missionary style (I don't know how else to call it?), facing me, puts her arms around my neck and kisses me on a cheek.

&amp;#x200B;

\-""Uh Katie, what are you doing?""

&amp;#x200B;

\-""Playing a game""

&amp;#x200B;

She managed to plant 2 more quick kisses on my cheek (getting uncomfortably close to my mouth) before I lifted her off me. She wouldn't let go of my neck at first, but eventually I managed to sit her down next to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked her if she plays these games a lot. She vaguely described that she ocassionaly does with her best friend, who's a girl the same age. I honestly never played these games with my friends, but I heard girls can be much ""closer?"" with their girlfriends, eitherway I didn't prod too much further.

&amp;#x200B;

I tell her that we should probably do something else, implying that there's more appropriate games we can play (Monopoly?). It must have came out wrong though, because without missing a beat she says:

&amp;#x200B;

\- ""What would you like me to do to you? ...Or I can kiss you again?""

&amp;#x200B;

The audacity and phrasing of the question stunned me. I never been painted into the corner with 2 false alternatives by a child. I chose 3rd option of ""We should call it a night"". She looked somewhere between sad, disappointing, and embarrassed.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't decide what I should do:

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Tell her really sternly that this behavior is innapropriate, and she should never do that. She's very self conscious and sensitive, and I'm afraid to make her feel like she's a bad person for what she did. I once told her jokingly to tie her shoelaces properly so she doesn't trip, and she still obsessively fixes them anytime I'm around.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Talk to her mother (dad is not in a picture... I know, shocking!...). I suspect her mother will chew her out, and tell her to never bother me again. I think that would be an overreaction, that might also damage her self-esteem.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Try not to be alone with her anymore. Ignore her affections as much as possible. Continue to gently remove myself out of difficult situations if they arise again.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I'm leaning towards Option 3, since it requires minimum actions on my part. This allows me to avoid confrontation, spare her feelings, and preserve certain amount of normalcy without it getting too weird.

\*EDIT:\* Thanks guys, you've been great. I never wanted this to get too popular, and I only expected 1 or 2 solid replies. I did however read through everyone's comments, and will continue to do so for as long as they come in. I have made a decision that I think will be correct one for everyone involved, and since I don't want this thread to become a circus this will be my last edit/post."

I offered to wear it to a friend’s 4 year old son’s birthday. What can I say or do to make it entertaining and fun for the kids besides just doing a few poses? Hey I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to offer suggestions.  I had a blast being Spiderman.  It's not everyday you get to be a Superhero for kids.  https://imgur.com/j115njl

  I made sure to have a can of silly string tucked inside the wrist of the costume ( i cut a small hole in the palm so I could shoot it out ).  The can was so well hidden that it was a cool surprise when I shot my friend in the face with it while posing for a picture.  My friend's were a little worried that their son might be scared of a costumed character, so I made sure to befriend and do my best not to scare him.  It worked and he led me from the bounce house to the living room to show me his train set ( https://imgur.com/WecRwvj) .  I took some Spiderman party favors with me and gave him a set of Spiderman pajamas.  One small boy gave me a hug and it was the cutest thing ever.  

I definitely had a blast and I'm looking forward to Halloween.  I'm actually going to email a children's hospitals around my city and volunteer to come visit if they'd ever like me to.

Quick edit: Thanks for all the kind words. Going to save this to read for the days when I feel depressed.

So, this all started around fall of 2019. I would pick him up in an SUV with him in the front passenger seat. We would talk about how practice is going, the weather, or just random chit chat. At one point, I noticed some suspicious movements in my peripheral vision. I glanced to see what was happening and quickly glanced away after noticing he was trying to covertly masturbate. He has never ""finished"" in the car.

This continued on and off when  pick him up. He doesn't do it every time, but more often then anyone would be comfortable pretending isn't happening.

Does he think he is sneaky or that I'm not bright enough to realize what is happening? This week, I drove him 30 minutes to and from a haircut. This was the first time the was an audible sound. I started to hum to the radio and try really hard to keep that a blind spot. Not sure he heard it as he had earbuds in. Thought he was done, then a continuation on the way back.

How do I get him to stop without directly confronting him. I tried making conversation and turning my head often so that he thinks it isn't safe to do, but that doesn't work. I don't want to embarrass or mortify him. He is at a tender age and has hormones going crazy. Asked his mom if he does it in her car and he doesn't. He doesn't do it when his uncle (my brother) picks him up either. Help!"

Cross posting for some exposure, don't really use reddit that much.

This is a bit of a weird situation, and one that is stupid but kind of hurts a little.

Backstory.

I was pretty ugly growing up. Not your ""oh, you just lack confidence"" sort of situation, but like, actually a pretty shit draw in the genetic lottery. I have kids who blurt out ""mom what's wrong with his face"" to me these days still. I don't let it get to me since it doesn't matter.

That said, it didn't really affect me growing up that much. I knew it early on, and instead I played the class clown, and was really outgoing.

Throughout high school I started lifting, and I'm actually quite built. It's just, the face is a huge turn off.

As for dating, I never really had much luck. I was always ""that guy friend"", that all the girls wanted. I listen, I'm compassionate I think.

Anyways, I have a girlfriend now. She loves me for who I am and I honestly could see a future with her.

She got her wisdom teeth removed last weekend. I was there with her, and she was talking with the nurse about her life goals and whatnot. She was pretty sedated and it was quite funny to be there. The nurse beckoned me over for something, and she mentioned to my gf that ""you have a handsome boyfriend"".

I knew she was being kind, but then my gf responded with something like this:

GF: ""Oh stop, you know he's not a looker at all but he's the kindest most caring person in the world"".

Nurse: ""that's not true, he seems like both!""

GF: ""he is ugggggly, wait until you see him"".

I've never let it affect me until then. I tuned out after hearing that. It really fucking stings.

So, I’m 18 weeks pregnant and living out of state with my fiancé. My mom is over the moon about getting her first grandbaby. 

My mom and I are best friends and always have been, she’s the best mother anyone could want and I hope I’m half as good to my baby as she is to me. 

My problem is, both of my parents smoke heavily and smoke inside their house. I don’t want my baby to be around smoke/smoking like I was when I was young. So I told her that if she wants baby to stay at her house, she has until baby’s born to stop smoking inside and get her house aired out. I didn’t think that was too much to ask but she got very upset.

She also thinks I’m being “a little extra” by going ahead and establishing my rules that no one can kiss my baby’s face and everyone needs the recommended vaccinations to be around my baby. And that kind of bothers me, especially with the measles outbreak and the growing number of people that don’t vaccinate. 

I’m not looking for anyone to bash my mom, she’s wonderful in every way, she’s just almost in her 70s and kind of set in her ways. I guess I’m just looking for some support and validation that I’m not being too much. Or if anyone knows of ways I can help her quit smoking or at least change the habit of smoking inside. Also, if anyone has any tips on ways she can get the smell out of her house that would be awesome."

One day he had a entire one sided conversation with me on exact words “I really hope you don’t end up like all these other teens girls! Don’t go around Fing like a rabbit!” Over and over on how he is advising me to not be like other girls and F like a rabbit. 

Another time he told me “if you ever want to learn a language. F*** someone who know that language. That’s how I learned English” (he came from France) 

He is the cause for most of my panic attacks, and won’t let me leave the room if I ask because I’m having one. 

I once reported to him that a kid was sexually harassing me. His response “well I understand why. You are a beautiful women.” 

Recently a kid reported him because he threw a broom at them. So he’s kinda on edge not trying to make wrong moves. But he’s still constantly yelling like Gordon Ramsley at us and cursing up a storm.

(really long post, sorry)  



TL;DR:

I'm a 28 year old man. I have no job, no friends, no family.  I weigh 550 pounds. I am on SSI disability for anxiety and PTSD and my weight. I have been homeless on and off since I was 16 years old.  I am on a waiting list for public housing. I'll be in an apartment in a month or two.


**How do I build a life?**

This is going to be long, sorry about that. And sorry for any spelling errors. It was very emotional for me to put all of this into words.


I was raised by two horrible and sick people.  My mother  is a narcassist and paranoid schizophrenic. I have had no contact with my mother in 10 years. My father is a pedophile, rapist and has borderline personality disorder.  I have had no contact with my father in 2 years. 

When I was young, my parents kept my sister and I completely isolated from people and culture. I have never played with a child my own age. I never learned to play or socialize with anyone.  She would read the bible to me and my sister for hours a day. We  were technically homeschooled, but never learned anything except the bible.  When my parents would leave, they would lock us inside the house, and tell us that if we left, people would kill us or abduct us or corrupt us.  

We had a small TV in the house, but no TV antenna. It was only for playing  certain videos that my parents approved. We could only watch church material and a few old movies. When my parents would leave the house, my mom would take the TV with her and lock it in her van, so we couldn't watch anything without their supervision. 

My mother also would regularly starve us. My mom was obsessed with health. She always thought she had cancer or something.

 She would feed me a tiny bowl of plain oatmeal for breakfast and a few leaves of lettuce and a small chunk of tuna(maybe the size of a quarter) for lunch.  When both parents were home, they'd almost always fight, and they'd each end up in different rooms, and my mom would be crying and my dad would be sleeping. My mom would say dinner was ""fend for yourself"".  We rarely had family dinners. I don't even remember them.  My sister usually make food for me and her. She'd make me ramen noodles or spaghetti or mac and cheese or whatever for dinner.   
My dad would over feed me when he could. On weekends he would take me to the McDonalds drive through and buy 12 cheeseburgers and let me binge. This was the only ""real"" food that I'd get for the week. My mom would never allow me to eat fast food.  My parents would eat their own food, but feed us crap. We weren't allowed to have the ""adult food"". (By the way, I thought this was normal until a few years ago).

It was pretty common for my sister and I to go to sleep hungry, and then with my acutely developed sense of smell, wake up and unbeknownst to them, sit at the top of the stairs, watching them eat pizza  and take out chinese food and other ""adult"" food.

When I was 10 years old, my dad left my mom, and took my sister and I to live with his mother on the other side of the country. To my sister and I, he was rescuing us. We loved him for this. We hated my mom.

At 10 years old, I was a horribly weird child. This was in the year 2000. I had never heard any music with lyrics before in my life. My mom would only let me listen to classical music because she was worried that the lyrics in music would corrupt me. 

I had my dad buy me a CD to listen to music for the first time. It was Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory. I was blown away. I didn't even know people could make those sounds with their voices. 

This is where my life opened up incredibly. Everything was amazing. My world got HUGE overnight.  TV, Music, culture, THE INTERNET! My dad bought my sister and I computers. I spent most of my teen years on my computer. It was amazing to me.

After moving across the country, my dad divorced my mom and got full custody of my sister and I. He enrolled us in school, and I went into 5th grade, and my sister in 7th. 

It was terrifying. I didn't even know how to talk to anyone. I had never met anyone my own age before. I didn't know half the words they were using. Everything almost sounded like a foreign language to me.  This lead to me being really awkward and getting bullied a lot.  I ended up dropping out of school when I was 13 and my sister did the same when she was 15.
My dad told the school that he was going to homeschool us. He never did.  We never did any homeschooling. I never graduated high school. 
Around this time, my dad started feeding me. And feeding me, and feeding me. I never had a mom to starve me. My dad had no idea how to cook. Every day was like this. Breakfast: 4 sausage mcmuffins, Lunch at the all you can eat Chinese Buffet, and dinner was a bucket of Fried Chicken. This lead to me ballooning to over 400 pounds by the time I was 14.

Around 2004, my dad leaves his PDA(kinda like a smartphone, minus the phone) in his car while I'm waiting for him. I decide to play a game on it. While I'm looking through it... I find pictures... of my sister. Naked. And pictures of various female family members(my grandma, my aunt), their heads photoshopped on to pictures of naked women, and lots of child porn.  I am confused. I have no idea what to make of this. I'm  14 years old. I quickly put the PDA away and pretend I never saw it. Over the years I'd realize the way my dad treated my sister, and it made me sick inside. I was worried he was molesting her. Apparently I learned last year from her, that he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14. And I mean ""teach"" her.... physically...

---- 
My dad was kind of a scam artist(I did not know this  at the time). He didn't have a job. What he did was go to desperate people who wanted to get out of their mortgages, and ""buy"" their houses, and then rent them out. Turns out he didn't really buy them, he got them to sign a quit claim deed to him, and they still kept the mortgage in their names, and he would rent the houses for a price over the mortgage. The owners kept the mortgages in their name, but my dad paid the mortgages with rent money from renters. He'd then ""rent to own"" those houses to people that would put $5000 down to buy these houses from him. 

He did this for a few years until he had 20+ houses. In late 2006, he decided he didn't want to be in this job anymore. He took all the rent money for October 2006 and didn't pay the mortgages, causing all of the old people he got the houses from to default on their mortgages.

Conveniently, my dad decided that we would drive acrossed the country to go on a long water fast together to lose weight.  So he drove us out to the Arizona desert in 2006 in a big box moving truck, and we both sat out there reading books for 40 days straight without eating, and only drinking water. (Now that I think back to this, I think this was child abuse, but I thought it was good at the time because I lost 100 pounds).


While we were out in the desert, all of his houses were being repossessed, including our own house.  When we got back we had no where to live. My sister was 18 at this time, and luckily for her, she had moved in with her boyfriend. I was stuck with my dad.  


Over the next 4 years we would be mostly homeless. Sometimes  squatting in abandonded houses, and during winter times(this was in Michigan), my dad put on a suit and tie and  would rent an office in a run down office building for the winter to keep us out of the cold. We'd sleep in offices while he cooked up another business plan that would eventually fail. Oh yeah, and I gained back the 100 pounds that I lost during this time, plus another 100 pounds for good measure.  In the summer of 2007, my dad convinced his mother to give control of her business, a well established local pet store, over to him.  We'd live in the back of the store. My dad did a lot of ""renovating"" of the store, but in reality was inflating the costs of the renovation and taking out loanss and skimming cash off the top.  By October 2008, this store of 40 years was out of business and all the employees were out of a job, and we were homeless again.  

So what did my dad do? Did he get a job? Nope.
 He put on a suit and tie, went to another run down office building, and rented out an office for $350 bucks a month for some new bullshit business for the next year. I went with him, because I had no where else to go. 
In the middle of winter 2009, his office building was set to be demolished so it could be turned into a parking lot for the new YMCA, so we were once again homeless. My sister begged her boyfriend to let us move in with him. He hated my father. But he eventually let us move in, but only for a few months. 

My dad ended up concocting a new plan while we were there. He decided that we should both go to college together and becoming nurses.. I was now 20 years old. He's in his 50s. At this point,  I  only have 2 years of elementary school under my belt.

He decides to make up some fake  trans scripts and a diploma for me, and has me apply for college out in Arizona, and of course apply for loans and grants.  
The community college there is incredibly cheap, and we'd end up getting a few thousand dollars in refunds back from loans and grants each semester, so it would pay for us to live and survive. He also faked some records so I could get in state tuition.

So we move out to Arizona, and now I'm in community college, totally unprepared, and every semester, further indebting myself for another one of my dad's schemes.  We do this for 3 years and I fake my way through college, really going nowhere. My dad encourages me to just take a bunch of classes to figure out what I want to do with my life, as long as I stay in full time so I can keep getting money to pay him for rent. My dad also has not taught me how to drive. Now I realize that he did this to keep me dependant on him. 

While this is happening, my sister loses her job and has a mental breakdown, tries to kill herself, and is hospitalized for awhile. She ends up getting on disability for her mental illnesses and is still on disability today.
 She is worried about me, and comes out to visit me in Arizona. She eventually helps me by buying me a car. I take the car, and teach myself to drive, against my dad's wishes (at this point, I'm 23, she's 25). Within a month of having my drivers license, my sister convinces me to move back in with her and leave my dad in Arizona. Now I see my dad cry for the first time ever. He's begging me not to abandon him. I almost decided to stay, but my sister begged me to move back to Michigan with her. So we did. 

Immediately after we left, my dad stops paying the bills(which are all in my name by the way, I did not know this, and this ends up ruining my credit). And he moves into his car.  

Within a month of living with my sister in Indiana, I have a job. Another month and I make some friends at work, and a month later I move in with 3 of them and we all share a house. This is by far, the best part of my life. I smoked weed for the first time with my new friends, and it was transcendent. I was having a great time. I'm working full time, 40-50 hours a week (just at walmart, but I actually loved my job). Every few days, I get emails from my dad, telling me how miserable he is living in his car, and how dangerous it is for him to live there. 

After 8 months of this, life is going great for me. And my dad shows up at my house in Michigan. He gives me a sob story and convinces me to let him live with me, in my bedroom.  He mentions that he wants to kill himself all the time. I reluctantly let him move in with me, but tell him he can only stay for a month, and he needs to go to the homeless shelter. 

Over the next month, he hates that I'm working full time. Its the holidays and I'm really busy at work. He resents that I'm working and I'm self sufficient. He sleeps all day while I'm at work and stays up all night in my bedroom on the internet watching movies and videos while I'm trying to sleep. My performance at work starts suffering... 


I end up getting injured and losing my job at walmart. I was clumsy because I was sleep deprived.  My dad seemed happy that I lost my job... I ended up telling him to leave. I can't handle it anymore. He moves out into the homeless shelter. He's furious at me. 

I decide to go back to college. I finally found a career that I think I want. I want to be a paramedic.  I go down to the local community college and sign up. I take out loans and grants to support myself.  A few weeks later I show up for my first class. 

Guess who's sitting in the front row? 

Yep. My dad. He wants to be a paramedic now too. 

This was a miserable semester. It was so fucking embarrasing to be in the class with my dad. I end up passing the EMT portion of the class, the first semester, and I drop out of the paramedic training. I just don't want to be around my dad.  

Around summer of 2014, my dad asks me for help cleaning out his storage room. I reluctantly oblige and help him.  I noticed something in the corner of the storage room. Its a locked aluminum box. I've  seen it before many times, and always wondered what was in it.   While he's doing something in his van, I check out the box, Its actually unlocked, so I open it. Inside.... is hundreds of  pictures, a few hard drives, KY jelly, tissues, and... my sister's underwear.  I slam it closed, and walk out of the storage room and take off. I left my dad without any explaination. Later that night I felt a horrible pain in my chest. I think I'm dying. I can't breathe. I can barely move. It feels like someone is sitting on my chest. There is crushing pain in the center of my chest and radiating up my face and down my arms. I'm sweating, I'm numb, and cold.  I stumble outside and call 911.  I tell them I'm dying. I'm having a heart attack. I'm only 24 years old.

After being in the hospital for 2 days, and undergoing cardiac stress tests and ultrasounds and everything, they diagnose me with panic disorder. It was just a panic attack. That's what a panic attack is? I had no idea. This felt real. It couldn't just be in my head, could it?  

Over the course of the next few months, I have these same events 3-4 times per day. I feel like I am absolutely, 100% dying, multiple times per day. My dad is now an EMT with the local ambulance service. If I call 911 again, he might be the one showing up  at my door.

It takes a few months, but I eventually break down and tell my sister what happened. I tell her what I found 10 years ago, and what I found 10 years later in his storage room. My psyche was not letting me hide this anymore. My sister felt terrible for me, and told me that she knew something was wrong with my dad. She told me he tried to teach her how to masturbate when she was 14, and tried to get her naked multiple times.

She decided to confront him. I couldn't bare to look him in the face. I was a coward. I couldn't look at him. I left her to confront this predator alone. 

She tells me that he told her that he admitted it. He said that he likes incest. He told me he'd get counselling for it.  My sister and I decided to cut off contact with him. This was in 2015, and I haven't talked to him since. He's emailed me a few times and told me he got concelling for it and is better now. He told me the consellor said that being attracted to his daughter was normal, and was understandable because the pain he went through with the divorce (???? bullshit).

Anyways, after all of this, it basically destroyed me. I couldn't work. I was having panic attacks every day. My sister convinced me to apply for disability. I did, but it would take 2 years for me to get it.

We both had no where to go. We felt unsafe sharing the town with my dad.  We decided to move to the woods in the middle of the country. We found a place that sold empty property with no money down, and we got 5 acres out in the middle of the woods. There was an old abandoned meth cooking shack on it. We found a lot of meth pipes in it. We cleaned it out and moved in.  My sister and I lived there for 2 years while we waited for me to get disability. I needed it. I was agoraphobic(still kinda am), and I needed to heal and be away from people. 

Once I got disability, my sister wanted to move back to live with one of her friends in Indiana. I applied for public housing in the local town closest to me in Missouri. I was approved and have an apartment waiting for me.

For the first time, at 28 years old, I'll be living by myself. Rent and utilities is 30% of my disability check.  After rent, I'll have $500 to spend per month. After other bills(phone/car insurance), I'll have $400 per month.
 
So here is my situation: I'm in the middle of the country, alone, no job, no friends, no family, no high school diploma, 550 pounds, and on disability. 

I do not want to stay on disability forever, but I'm not sure where to start building a life. I am very alone, and I've never been completely alone before. I'm scared, and could use advice.

Last night my brother (17M) came into my (17F) room and stroaked/ touched my inner thigh right by my genital area while was asleep. The touching woke me up and he left the room soon after but not before i noticed that he had his dick out. I didnt know how to react to this so i kept quiet.

He has done inappropriate things to me before but ive tried to write it off. Like the time i had a cat on my lap and he kept touching/ gracing my genitals while petting the cat, despite me wiggling away and trying to slightly reposition myself. Or that time we were alone in the house (we bothe live with our parents) sitting in the livingroom on diffrent couches and i relized that he had his dick out and was just casually touching it?

 Is this normal behaviour and am i just overreacting? I feel super dirty and ashamed about the situation and dont know what to do. I would like to just ignore it but i feel like hes escalating his beaviour and i dont want it to get worse.

Edit: Okay i was not expecting this to get as much attention as it has. Sorry for not replying to anyone i just needed to sleep on the issue to try to decide what to do. Im going to be speaking with my parents about this because as a few of you pointed out, even if i speak to him and he stops its still very possible that he will do this or worse to someone else. Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice, it has truly made me relize that this isnt something i can just ignore."

He tried saving one of the victims lives.

 He and his friend were playing corn hole when they heard the guns go off only 15 feet away from where they were playing, everyone at the party ran sepereate ways, he and his buddy ran and grabbed one of the guys, and drove 120mph to the hospital ER the kid had 8 gun shots in him, 6 in his stomach, and my bro carried him in to the hospital, his clothes were soaked in blood. 

He keeps saying he's fine. But two people died, he witnessed one die in his arms on the way to the hospital, he carried in a lifeless body, and wore this man's blood. 

My brother could have been one of the kids...but he wasn't, and tried saving one, and all he keeps saying is ""I tried"" ""I tried to save him""

What do I do? I don't know how to help him. He is a string kid, both physically and mentally, but something like this would break even the strongest person down.

Edit:
I have literally read through all of your comments, and as normal, the reddit community as come together to assist. Thankyou, even those of you being snark assholes, thankyou, gave me a laugh. Not a lot of things fuck me up mentally, but watching my baby brother attempt to contemplate what had just happened, then try and assist the man brings me a sense of pain, but I  gained a whole new form of respect for him. 

He is a hero in my eyes, you all can say whatever you want about how he should've done this, or should have done that. He is a minor, he did what he thought was the right thing in the moment. As many times as the kid was shot, and he was shot from only a couple feet away ag first, the boy was most likely dead or either close to death when they grabbed him off the ground. He is a hero to me.

Update:
Nothing has changed. He is still his normal cocky self, he has become slightly more defiant toward my parents, and is trying to stay away from home. I keep inviting him out to eat, and to swim, and to come to my place and play video games. He says yes everytime and then never answers the phone. He's dealing in his own way, I just hope he has someone to hold him up, he isn't allowing me to.

Uodate 2: he was pulled from football practice by his guidance counselor from this year, they talked for 2 hours and he referred him to a professional ag our local hospital. He is doing much better. If he starts talking about it though, he keeps talking. He gets weirded out with certain hip hop songs now due to the song speaking on using guns. But he's better.

Update 3: counseling has helped tremendously. His football team has also helped tremendously. I thank all of you from the bottom of my being for giving me advice. He's gonna be okay, he won't even look at beer anymore, he says ""I was buzzed that night, I don't ever wanna risk being buzzed again if something like that happens again"" I'm sure he will change his mind one day, but I'll take it while he is still in high school. He works out alot more than usual, so I assume that's where he gets his frustrations out, he has football practice in the am from 6-10am then he goes to the gym for another 2-3 hours at night. He's a good kid. Thanks guys!"

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

Per the title post, I am a female LEO. Last week I had posted a picture (Facebook and Instagram) of me out by my neighborhood pool in a bikini. I should mention, this is not a thong bikini, or one that is too small for my figure. It is literally a bikini I bought from Kroger. A very normal, not seductive, average bikini. No cleavage or booty shown in the picture. 

When I first started out at my department, I was uncomfortable adding ANYONE from my workplace to Facebook. But, I kept getting more and more requests from colleagues. I thought, ""why not, I really dont have anything to hide. I dont post anything political or sensitive. I have no pictures of me that should or would ruin my career"" It shouldnt be a problem adding them back, right? WRONG.

Today, I was approached by a male officer in my department (that is non existent in the social media world). His exact words ""you need to be really careful about what you post on social media. Someone showed me a picture you posted... and that kinda stuff can get you fired"". 

I looked at him like a deer in headlights... like are you f***ing serious dude? How is this any different than my Male colleagues posting their shirtless gym flexing selfies? 

What irritated me beyond belief, is the fact that the officer that confronted me about this isnt on social media, so one of my other (most likely Male) collegues that I am friends with on Facebook, showed him this picture. 

Sure, I am in a career where my professionalism is important on and off duty and I respect that. But am I being held to a different standard here because im a female? Or am I in the wrong? I am always open for a nice discussion so please give me your thoughts

EDIT: I didn't think I would get this many responses. Although it's not feasible for me to reply to each person, I'm going through trying to read each response. I've gotten great feedback so far, thank you guys.

EDIT: My profile is set on private, for those asking. Also, I did know about limiting who can see certain posts I make, I just didnt think my picture was going to cause such an issue. I DIDNT know about the option of grouping my colleagues together on Facebook, so thank you to whomever recommended that.

EDIT: I think the best option at this point is to delete all colleagues from social media. I know not all of them may have negative intentions, but I deserve to have a life outside of work, and not worry that my coworkers are scrutinizing everything I do.

EDIT: Whoa, a Silver! Thanks!"

So today has been really shitty for me.  And I mean,  really,  really shitty.  I woke up from a horrific dream that affected me and made cry during the day whenever I thought about it,  I took a diazapham tablet just to calm me enough, but all in all,  I've been pretty out of it today.  I made a few mistakes at work but not that drastic until this arvo.  My mum is very verbally abusive,  which is why I'm living independently at 16. And today it was non stop. 
A couple came in to return a 1000 dollar reel for a bigger version,  and they left it on the front counter with me, I put it right infront of me to watch it.  I served a guy,  he bought a $600 fridge,  and I must've missed him pick up the reel and walk out with it.  At the time,  I had received another message from my mum and I was reading it.  This is all on camera, and my manager came up infront of all my teammates and the couple,  she told me it was cause I was on my phone and she was pissed. She said to go get my stuff and piss off,  I wasn't even finished with my job.  She held everyone back to help except me,  I was mortified.  I don't blame her,  I love my manager and I know it's my fault.  Im fairly new,  so it's still really hard for me to fit in,  and I get anxious everytime I walk through the doors, and I  have no fucking clue how I'm supposed to go in tomorrow. 

Ps: 
My manager just called me,  she said the reel was  returned and they copped a whole lot of abuse from the guys'  daughter. But apparently they all stood up for me,  and the couple even said they werent angry at me,  and it was really shitty for a grown man to steal from a young girl. She was super lovely,  she told me she's not angry and she just wanted to see how I was going and told me not to stress, and that if I ever needed anything to call her. This made me feel a lot better,  but I would love any advice I could get ♥ "

How do I get her to stop? I (M16) am acquaintances with a friend's friend (F13). She's pretty chill to hang out with, and I don't mind being friends with middle schoolers, but she just wont stop hitting on me. I guess talking for four days makes us the best of friends, because she acts like we've been friends all her life around other people. I have made it deliberately clear that we don't know each other that well, I'm gay, I'm seeing someone, and that I'm not interested in anybody under 15 anyways.

To make matters worse, one of her friends (F11) ships us, which is a) fueling the fire, and b) really uncomfortable for me, as I don't want an 11 year old thinking about me in that context.

How do I get them both to stop? Like she's a pretty good friend but this is just really uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I've talked to her about it, and she seems to get it. I've told her that if she doesn't stop I'll have to cut her off. We'll see how this goes. If she keeps it up I'll update.

And to clarify for the people who are confused:

\-I'm in the U.S.

\-I'm not friends with the 11 year old, they just hang out a lot so I see her occasionally.

\-The 13 year old is 14 soon, so I dont really see a big problem talking to her if she'll be in highschool next schoolyear.

\-Yes, I have told her I'm gay and uncomfortable, I'm here cause she wouldn't stop"

This is the second time he has done it, this time he stole my Visa card instead of my parent's. I am currently trying to refund the money. However, i am more concerned about him, my parents are too busy to care and they gave me full authority to deal with his case. They told me to take his pc and his phone, but he doesn't have friends or anything to do without them. How can i punish him in a way that gives him a life lesson?   


I thought of making him work to earn the money back and buy what he wants with it, what do you think?   


Your help is much appreciated.

Edit: i went through his email and found out he connected my parents card into paypal, didn’t count all the transactions but seems like sh*t ton of money. He is also giving youtubers lots of money through patreon. I also discovered he is not doing well in school and is barley passing his exams. 

This is bigger than i thought, i am really shocked, he is using more money each month than i am earning. I took his pc and phone while he’s sleeping. I am currently writing all the transactions incase of refunds. I can’t parent this idiot, i will tell my parents to deal with him. Thank you for the advices though.

Edit2: i will give you guys an update when he wakes up, thank you all for the advices, some seem extreme to me, he’s a piece of shit but he’s still my brother, i love him and want to help him. I will take him to the police station after school, they have programs for people like him.

Update: my mom whooped his ass, she was chasing him and throwing everything near her at him. My father was calm about it and told me to simply sell his pc and destroy his phone. We decided not to take him to the police, fearing they would take him from us. Will make him the neighborhood slave until summer. Before i dropped him to school, i gave him a good lecture about everything you guys said. 

Thank you reddit.

Update2: i drank a beer while watching him shoveling the entire neighborhood street snow. We talked with his teacher and she said she will make sure he will socialize more in school. I am currently unable to return the money, Roblox closed his account without issuing me a refund, then they said you don’t have an account by this name but I had some success with amazon, they were great. I will take a day off tomorrow to try to refund all his purchases.

Update3: i am sorry if I offended anyone by my updates, but you guys don’t know anything about my parents. They are shitty parents but they are that way because of their workaholic habits. They really don’t have time to parent him, they really don’t. They see him once or twice a week and most of the time it’s up to me and my sister to take care of him. Say what you will about them but don’t blame me for not being a good “parent” to him. I am only 24 years old and I don’t know shitt about parenting, especially for someone like him and that’s why i came here for help. 

Also don’t forget that these “shitty parents” raised me as well with basically same conditions and I turned out to be fine. What he has done is not his parents fault, it’s the new age fault, that they failed to adapt to. How would you explain technology to 50 year old parents. I will keep you updated."

I apologize if updates aren't allowed, I messaged the mods and got no response so I'm just going to ask for forgiveness instead of permission.

Some helpful people suggested I contact my local version of the Big Brother program, and they were happy to help me out getting everything official and less sketchy, although they needed her guardian's permission first. On my part I needed to get a background check from the police.

I sat down with her and explained what I was planning, and she seemed excited. I was a bit worried about what would happen when I asked to contact her parents as previous attempts had not been successful, but she gave me their phone number, and we got to chatting about the fun things we could do outside of just playing tennis.

I gave her mother a call the next day and explained who I was, how I knew her daughter and why I thought it would be a good idea for me to become her Big Brother. Her mother seemed very weirded out, understandably, but over all pretty nice. We agreed that I would drive her home the next time we played tennis so we could meet in person.

The day came and after kicking her ass (my forehand is mint boi), we hopped in the car and headed to her place. Her mother was just as I imagined from speaking on the phone, a completely normal human being. Her father however was a different story. If I say he was creepy it implies something sexual, but I don't mean creepy in that way. He had almost no emotions, he smiled when he first saw me, but it was not a normal smile. If I said something funny and he would laugh, but it was like a robot might laugh. Very fucking bizarre dude, just something off about him. Overall though I thought our meeting went well, they just asked that I wait until I got my background check before I did anything other than play tennis with her which is super reasonable and I'm actually glad they weren't willing to sign their kid up to some strange dude without it.

I went home and was super happy with how everything went. I was a tad worried her house was going to be some shit-hole and her parents were going to be druggies, but my fears were thankfully unfounded. A few days went past, and I was chillin', when I got a knock on the door. I open it and 3 cops are standing there looking too happy to see me. They ask me to come down to the station for an interview about the girl, although they tell me I'm not being arrested and it is voluntary. I may come across as naive in my last post, but even I can see that I need a fucking lawyer, so I tell them I'll meet with them when the time suits me.

After frantically Googling around for a lawyer, I find one who seems to be competent. He rings the police station and asks what they want to interview me about, but they are tight-lipped and only let on that it's about me hanging out with the kid. I speak to my lawyer for a bit and despite his hesitation, I agree to meet with the police and try and explain whats going on. I bring with me as much evidence as I can, my call logs to child services (surprisingly difficult to request that where I live annoyingly), my correspondences with the Big Brother people, I even printed off my Reddit post. Anything to make me look like the upstanding person I am.

The interview was nice, when I started laying out evidence of my good-intent they were surprisingly accepting of it. The fact that I had made multiple calls to child services went a long way to convincing them I meant no harm. There were a couple of things that irked me though, and I don't know if they will ever stop irking me. I overheard the police multiple times say ""he's not the guy"". The way they said it implied they were still looking for someone after me. The next thing that irked me was one of the officers told me that the reason he didn't think it was me was because ""when she texted you and said her boobs were sore, you didn't engage."" I've read through our text messages 3 times now looking for anything vaguely similar to that sentiment and I'm coming up with zip. I mean, I know nothing would turn up because I have never talked to a kid about their boobs in my life, but still I've triple checked.

I've thought it over and over in my mind, and the only conclusion I can make is that I was not the only man she was interacting with. I can't think of anything else. Why else would the police imply they'll keep looking for someone after clearing me? And then to bring up a conversation that never happened? He must've confused my convos with someone else's. At least if she has been interacting with other people in inappropriate ways the police are involved and they can catch the guy, but sure as shit I'm not speaking to her ever again.

Thank you to everyone for their advice, it definitely was inappropriate of me to be hanging out with her alone and I'm glad you guys told me so. My background check came in the mail today and so I think I will still go ahead with signing up with the Big Brother program, but it will be with a random kid and more importantly with their parents permission.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: My lawyer was with me for the police interview, he just thought it was a bad idea. What does he know though, pfft I've seen Better Call Saul Season 1, I know all about the law."

What do I do? So about an hour and a half ago, I was asleep, and I heard my door open, and a girl walked in and got in bed with me, pulled the blanket over themselves, and passed out. I didn’t think much of it, because I have a friend who will occasionally just climb into my bed if she was out drinking with my roommates or whatever, so I just assumed it was her. 
I fell asleep for a bit, then woke up again and I could see this girls back, and she had a tattoo that I knew my friend didn’t have. I also saw that she isn’t wearing any pants or undergarments. 
So now I have a bare butted total stranger in bed with me and I’m not sure what to do. I live in a college town, and school is starting up again very soon, lots of people were partying tonight and I’m concerned that this is some wasted freshman girl or something like that, or maybe she’s been drugged. I really have no idea what to do in this situation.

Edit!
Alright so here’s what happened:
Around the same time I made my reddit post, I posted in the group chat that has my housemates in it, basically just explaining everything I did in this post. Since it was so late I didn’t think they’d respond which is why i posted here in the first place, but one of them responded that she was a girl he’s been seeing recently, so I decided to wake her up after that, and he came down and got her. She was drunk, and I think she just got turned around in our house and ended up in the wrong room since she didn’t know the place very well. In any case, this girl turned out not to be a complete stranger, there were no sexual assault implications, and everything turned out fine, if a little bit awkward for everyone involved. 
And to clarify for those wondering, I live in a rented house in a college town, not a dorm, and we always make sure to lock up the house at night, which is why I assumed at first that she was my friend, let in by one of my roommates, and why I was extra confused when it turned out it wasn’t her lol."

I’ve helped her twice already but she keeps going back to him. Should I just give up? Context: I am a foreigner currently living in Japan. I teach English at a high school in Sendai. I have been living here for about 3 years and the situation is exactly what it says on the tin. My female neighbor keeps coming to me for help with her abusive boyfriend, But she keeps going back to the same guy no matter how much I help her out.

The first time I helped her out was about a year and a half ago. she was breaking up with him and she came over to my house. She knocked on the door and she was a mess. Covered in bruises and crying her eyes out. She asked me if she could stay while she called the cops. Apparently when she tried breaking up with him, He freaked out and started throwing shit and hitting her. So she locked herself in the bathroom and climbed out of the window.

She came to me because I’m a big scary foreigner with tons of tattoos. If you don’t know, Japanese people can be pretty judgmental about that stuff. So they all think I’m a violent psychopath. **I’m really a sweetheart though** this was also the first time we interacted beyond me introducing myself when I first moved in. Anyway I let her stay while she called the cops because I’m not a fucking monster. 

So he comes over to try and bring her back or something. But he Changed his mind really quick when I answered the door. **Being ostracized in Japan has its advantages on occasion**

I didn’t want to fight the guy so I just tell him to get lost and not come back. So he leaves and the cops come and arrest his ass. I feel bad for the girl so I get her in contact with some local battered women’s organization and check up on her every now and then to make sure she’s doing alright. 

So problem solved right? The bad guy is gone, she’s getting the help she needs, happy ending right? NOPE.

Three months later she has bailed the idiot out and is back together with the dude. I was pretty upset when I found out but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. That was apparently the wrong move because the same situation happens. They get into a fight, he beats the shit out of her, she comes running over and the dude gets hauled away again. 

At this point I have it figured out that this guy fucked with her head pretty bad. So I decide I need to be more involved with her recovery. In order for her to break whatever mindfuckery this guy did to her.

So I start going with her to meetings and having dinner with her to try and make her feel better. I even set her up with some girls from my work so she can have some friends and start to build a support network. I introduced her to a psychiatrist specializing in domestic abuse so she can work through this issue with professional help. 

She seemed like she was getting her life together so I start to let her do her own thing little by little. After about 8 months everything is pretty much back to normal. Until I discover that she has bailed shithead out of jail again and he is back to his shitheaddery ways.

At this point the logical side of my brain is telling me that this girl is beyond saving.

I do believe that some people are simply to fucked up in the head to be helped. I have tried to help her twice. 


**Update**: First off I would like to say thanks to everybody for the help. I was mostly doing this as a way to vent my frustration but i'm honestly surprised at the amount of advice I have gotten.

**My decision**: After reading through the comments and asking myself what I wanted to do. I helped her out **ONE** final time. I decided to use a rather unique way of helping her, one I am particularly proud of coming up with if I do say so myself. I decided that this is not a one person issue, but a community issue. It being a community issue it makes sense to get said community involved. correct?

Coming to this decision, the first thing I did was get her moved to another house that one of my coworkers kindly allowed her to use. I got an overnight moving service that ""FriendlyFellowDboy"" mentioned to get her stuff moved over there. Shithead was out fucking call girls at a love hotel so we had plenty of time. The next thing I did was talk to my neighbors about the situation. **I don't know if they knew about it at the time. I didn't particularly care as long as they helped me**. I convinced them to make sure to call the police if he does something crazy.
Next I went to my coworkers and asked them for help in keeping an eye on her and having them talk to her, including anything they could donate.

However there was an unexpected consequence in doing this. My students and their parents have now found out about it and are offering their help. I didn't want to get my students involved in this because they should be focused on school. But now they are handing me things to donate to her.**Things like: cards, prayer slips, daruma dolls, food, clothing, you name it**. The parents have started to get me in contact with local psychologists and therapists and spreading the word.

I even talked to some of my buddies in the yakuza. **i mentioned how I made friends with the yakuza down below**. But they said that they will donate stuff and keep an eye on the guy.The local shrines has also gotten involved and is spreading the word. my phone has been blowing up non-stop and people are constantly knocking on my door.I could write a novel from the list of people and places that are offering help. But i'm obviously not going to do that. 

After witnessing all of the support and love she see's that she is getting, I hope she can finally break the hold this guy has over her. After which she can get her life back on track.

But

She is going to be doing it without me there.

A little about myself and how this situation has affected me. Before moving to japan I was in special forces for 10 years. I did many horrible things while I was in. I don't regret that I did these things. But i'm not proud of them. I know the reasons I had for doing them are reprehensible. Killing people for money. For what they **may** do. Or walking away from a woman being murdered in the street because command told us it wasn't our problem. I always told myself, ""**Who cares about the reasons? They're dead and you aren't. Live your life, and don't look back**"" That was enough for me, for a very long time. I can still say I don't regret that i'm alive. Or that I did them. But this situation and the emotions that have been brought up along with it, **have rocked me to my core**. I don't know if it's the two sides of me fighting with each other over what I should do.

The perfect killer. Telling me to walk away. That it isn't my problem.

Or the human being. Saying ""This person is begging for help. Are you going to walk away again? Just like you did in that hellhole of a place.""

It has forced me to confront my very soul. Not because of the situation itself. But because of the internal questions it brings up. I no longer wish to be a part of this. Over the past few months, I have been externally calm. But on the inside, I have never been more conflicted. Tonight i'm going to tell her that she is on her own from now on. My contract with the school ends in 2 months. I got offered to teach at a private school in tokyo, and i'm going to take it. I feel that done all I can, it's up to her now. I can honestly say this has been one of the more interesting times in my life.

I appreciate all the help everyone has given me. It has made a difficult moral decision easier to make, and has convinced me that i'm not completely callous. I am washing my hands of this situation. It's up to her now."

I'm on my phone and in a pretty shitty place right now. Please, excuse my grammar and what not because my autto correct sucks.

I lost my father the day before Halloween 2018, my mother New Year's Eve, and I have to make the decision to end life support for my little brother (34 years old) in the next few days due to a failed suicide attempt. I don't know how to mentally deal with this. 

I kept it together for my mom after my dad passed, so I never got to really deal with that emotionally. I was a mess after my mom passed and I'm still working through that. But my brother seems to have broken me. I can't lie I just want to curl up and bawl my eyes out. I have no other sibblings so everything I've known my entire life has been taken away in 5 months. 

Back story on my brother, my dad died in my brothers arms. He went way off the deep end and ended up making some bad choices in the weeks after my dad's passing. He wound up at a place he shouldn't have been and killed someone and had been in jail since early December. He's been pretty down about the situation but it was starting to to look more positive and he knew that. We talked Friday night and everything seemed great. He was happy and then Sunday the jail calls me. I had a gut feeling why. I kept it together until yesterday when I visited the hospital and saw him. 

I have so much going on I don't know where to begin. I don't know what's normal to feel. At this point I feel lost, devoid of life, and like I'm on autopilot. My wife doesn't understand though. She's amazing support, she's there, but it gives me no comfort.

Maybe none of this may make sense, I'm rambling from a hobby lobby parking lot, delaying going to see my brother again. Before you ask I have a mental health appointment next week, so I am looking out for myself."

I've been with her for the past 4 years, she's already tried committing suicide multiple times. I no longer love her, she's abusive towards her parents and I have to constantly watch out for her. During the past 3 years I've been putting up with her and her mental problems so she won't try killing herself. 

Yesterday it was too much to bear and I finally told her all the truth and that I no longer wanted to be with her. She first begged me to stay, but when that didn't work she then sent me pictures of her taking pills and saying things like it would all be my fault. I had to come back to her place at 4AM to take her to the hospital, with her parents also coming with her. 

It's gotten to the point where I just want to leave, maybe if I ghost her she won't be able to threaten me. I don't care what her family thinks anymore, I just want to leave this prison and never look back.

EDIT: Sorry for not answering, I've only slept 3 hours and just wanted to drive home and get in bed to forget about everything. She's fine, she took lorazepam, but the amount taken combined with her body weight made the effect less severe. I took the rest of the pills and the alcohol out of her house before leaving. She's out of the hospital now and has sent me over 50 texts, at first saying she thought I didn't care about her, then self pity, then making me feel guilty for everything. This has happened before, but unlike before I won't answer, not again. I hope she finds the help she needs and accepts I'm not a part of her life anymore.

EDIT 2: She contacted a friend in common to tell me she'd be jumping from a bridge if I didn't answer before 2AM, I told my friend not to tell her I've received the message. She didn't do anything. Without being sure her threats have reached me she won't do anything stupid because she knows she won't be able to get my attention.

I've already got an appointment with my therapist, which I've been seeing for some months now. Without her help and your reassurance this would've been much harder. Thank you all."

I ended it because of a few reasons. The biggest reason is because of his anger issues. If I didn’t do or say exactly what he wanted me to, he would get extremely angry (yelling at the top of his lungs, throwing objects, push me, etc) and say hurtful things. I know you are thinking “why did she stay with this guy?”. I would ask myself the same thing over and over but still find myself wanting to stay because I wanted to believe these things would just work itself out. Six months ago, the arguing and fights began to intensify and I started to resent him. Two weeks ago we were in the car and he was criticizing me over a situation I was venting to him about, so I asked him why he always had to critique everything I did (no yelling on my part). He exploded in anger, told he was so angry he wanted to punch me in the face and tried to push me out of the car in the middle of the street with moving traffic. We ended up pulling over in a parking lot and I got out the car to walk on my own because I was scared and couldn’t believe what was happening. As I started walking off, he gets out of his car and walks into the middle of the road with oncoming traffic and refused to get out of the street until I personally removed him. Cars braked rapidly and there was a lot of honking, while I am crying and pulling this man out of the road. I called a mutual friend of ours who can usually help call him down, and he did. He promised me for the millionth time he wasn’t going to yell at me again and act out, I decided to let it slide once again. However, I didn’t really let it slide because I kept replaying that scene over and over again in my head. Last week he yelled at me in the middle of a Dave &amp; Busters over a parking spot, in front of everyone. I have begged him to go to therapy with me and he says it’s a waste of money and that no therapist knows what they’re talking about, 

Today, I decided that I needed to end the relationship for good. I wasn’t happy anymore and his anger had officially pushed me over the edge. I couldn’t even look at him the same way anymore. I told him everything I was feeling and I figured he would be really upset. He once again promised things would change and to give him a chance, begging me to stay. It hurt but I knew it was the right thing to do. I stood firm and said I no longer wanted to be with him. He started sending me text messages saying he was going to kill himself because of the breakup. I immediately got him on the phone and it just kept getting worse. I tried my best to calm him down but all he wanted to hear was that I would take him back. I didn’t want to lie to him and couldn’t give a false promise and he didn’t take that well. I decided to call his mother because I was afraid he would actually hurt himself. I was at my dad’s house while this was happening and he ended up going to my apartment (he has a key) to see if he would run into me, He then sent me text messages with pictures of him holding a suicide note and telling me that he loved me but he was done living if he couldn’t have me. He ended up taking a bunch of pain killers and was drinking alcohol. My roommate found him in my bathroom barely able to stay awake. I rushed home while they called 911. Thankfully, we got him help at the right time and they were able to treat him for the OD. He is now at the hospital on a three day suicide watch. I stayed at the ER until his mother arrived and I spoke to him for a few minutes. He was hazy and crying, it broke my heart even more. I decided to leave to give him some space to rest and clear his head. 

I am battling these feelings that it’s my fault and I shouldn’t have broken up with him. Everyone tells me it’s not but I cant help feeling this way. I am overwhelmed. When I got home, I found the suicide note he wrote me. He had left his bank information and said he was leaving me all his money, and to donate his organs. I don’t even know what to feel or what to do right now. I am still in shock. Have I really been in a toxic relationship for two years? How did I let it get this bad? What is wrong with me? I want to visit him in the hospital to be there for him as a friend but I am not sure if that is a good idea, I don’t know what to do. It feels like a bad dream."

Every time I go over to the window I see him skulking away. It is now 5:30 AM and I was woken up by him tapping at my window. I called the police and they couldn't do anything because nobody could find him. What should I do?

Edit: Okay, so I'm getting many responses about firearms. This is definitely not something I'm interested in doing for multiple reasons.

Edit 2: Hey everyone. I've been looking into a few things. So first and foremost, we all know that everything is half shut down right now, especially for me, since I live in NYC and this city is a hotspot for ther virus. Because of this, many places are closed, I can't exactly order anything which will get here in time for tonight. I'm planning on going to home depot to see if I can find anything I'm looking for.nIn the meantime, I've talked to my friend and me and him are going to wait outside my apartment tonight with an extra bright flashlight and see if this man shows up again. I want to be on the offensive. I will update later tonight or tomorrow if anything happens.

Edit 3: So some of you are saying my plan is a bad idea, which... is probably true now that I think about it. If he has a gun and I'm unarmed this could end very badly for me, especially if we startle him with a flashlight. Some of you suggested putting a sign on my window. I am going to do this. My new plan is to wait outside with my friend like before, after putting the sign on my window. If this person comes by and is undeterred I will phone the police while keeping a safe distance across the street with my friend. Again, will update if anything happens.

UPDATE! - I am currently waiting across the street with my friend. We are planning to spend the entire night here. We have beef jerky and breath of the wild on my switch to keep us occupied. Wish us luck.

FINAL UPDATE! - Whoever guessed that a drug dealer used to live in my apartment is right. The guy who was tapping my window came by as expected around 4:30 last night. Me and my friend decided he didn't look too threatening so we confronted him! I asked him why he's been coming by for the last 4 nights. He told me he was looking for Seon with the edibles... I'm not sure what happened to Seon with the edibles. Nobody had been living here for like a year before I moved in. Anyway... That about sums up this mystery. Thanks for the advice everyone!"

I was at my tennis club waiting for my  mate to get there one day so we could practice a bit, when he texted me  and said he couldn't make it. No big deal, there is normally someone  there I can have a hit with or at least sit and watch for a bit. No such  luck, the only person there was a 12 year old girl all by herself. This is weird because we don't have any junior teams but I figured why no  ask her for a hit. We got a talking a bit and I found out that she's  newish to our city and her parents just dropped her off there and left,  and she was just going to walk home whenever she wanted. This struck me  as unusual, but I did similar things at that age so it didn't ring too many alarm bells tbh.

Eventually some other guys showed up and I introduced her as the lost child she  was and they joined us for a bit. After a few sets they wanted to go and  practice for real, and I don't have that much stamina so I was looking  to head off. I asked her if she had any friends she could play with  normally and she told she doesn't at school, she was just planning on  coming to the club and seeing who she could find. This is where I  suppose I made a risky judgment call and gave her my phone number and  said to text me if she ever wanted a hit.

Fast forward a few months and I would consider us friends. We go out once a  week for a hit of tennis, she tells me about her life and me about mine.  I made some calls to my junior club and managed to get her signed up as  a fill-in for some teams, and even once got her dinner once because her  parents were off god knows where.

This is the main point of contention. Her parents don't know I exist and  tbh, I don't know that they exist with 100% certainty, I've never seen them nor spoken to them. They are very much absent a lot of the time  (not abusive though, I've done all the phone calls and whatnot) and I  can tell it weighs heavily on her. This makes me extremely uncomfortable  as I am well aware of the implications of hanging out with a 12 year  old girl as a 19-20 dude. At the same time though, I'm her only friend  at the moment. I've done my best to help her make new friends her own  age and with similar interests, and at some point I feel like for both  of us it's best we part ways.

I just want the best for her, she's extremely intelligent and capable and  I do legitimately care for her, and only being friends with a grown ass-dude is not the best thing for her. I just wonder if cutting her off  now would make me an asshole and do more harm than good. I have asked friends and they give me a  mixture of ""what are you waiting for"" and ""how could you even think  about it"". Maybe I should wait until she makes at least one other friend?"

Recently she got her phone taken away by her parents for about 2 weeks during that time I gave her one of my old phones so we could still communicate using snapchat. We have exchanged nudes in the past but not frequently. We both have each other nudes saved on our snapchat conversation. While her parents had her phone her mom saw and mentioned to my gf that she saw the nudes but also mentioned that she quickly looked away and made sure her stepdad did not see and put the phone in a family safe that only her parents know the code to. After she got her phone back within minutes stepdad broke it while in a argument with her which he later apologized for and promised to replace it. About 4 days after the argument where her phone was broken she got a new one and proceeded in life normally. It's been about a week and a half since she got her new phone and during that time she never had a need to text her stepdad and would instead call him most of the time if she needed to speak to him. Today he asked her to text him what she wanted to eat and she realized when she scrolled up that nudes from her old phone had been sent to her stepdad while it should have been in the safe. We checked the dates that it was sent and that was during the time when the phone wasn't in her position. There was nude pictures and videos that would normally require a password to access. I should mention that since she logged into snapchat on the used phone I gave her during the time her phone was taken, snapchat logged out of her actual phone because it can only be on one device at a time. She later realized that her stepfather has known the password she used most of the time including for snapchat and her email meaning he could log into her snapchat account. During the time her phone  was taken she was randomly logged out from my used phone and couldn't log back in for a period of time and the time and date match to when the nudes were sent. Her mom does not know and is away for the next 4 days in a foreign country. She is currently there alone with her stepdad. What should she do?


UPDATE!!!.... She told her mom before she got back from said foreign country and her mom advised her to remain normal until she got back the next day. Her mom also made her stay at her grandma's house and when she got back she confronted her stepdad. Initially the stepdad denied it over and over but when her mom said she has proof he admitted to doing it and gave silly excuses why like saying ""he wanted to protect my gf"". My gf mom proceeded to kick him out and told him not to come back. He after hearing that he tried to stab himself with a screwdriver but her mom threatened to call the police and he left. It's been 2 days since that happened and he has continuously tried to guilt my gf mom and accused her of cheating soo he dosent look bad. Her mom is understandably devastated and completely confused (this was her Significant Other/husband for over 10+ years) and she has since sought therapy for advice on how to proceed. They've ultimately decided not to press charges and agreed that they just want him out of their lives"

Am I really setting women back? Isn’t feminism about having the choice to do whatever you want? Just some background to this. I’ve worked hard for ten years. I’ve never not had a job and I supported my ex husband financially pretty comfortably when he rarely worked and would stay at home and play WoW.

I’m in a new relationship now and it’s leading down the road of marriage, family etc. 

Every serious relationship I’ve had I’ve been the breadwinner, same is true for my current relationship: he’s a student and picks up casual work from time to time however this is the last year of his masters and I really want a break. Namely to write, study, sew and do whatever the hell I need to do to destress and hopefully start a family. (I’ve been battling fertility issues also) 

We’ve talked about it and he’s actually excited to have all his meals cooked for him by me, the house way more organised than it is now, having someone to welcome him home and have all his errands done for him. I shared this with friend and she really put me down about essentially wanting to be a 50s housewife but I’ve argued I’ll also be studying or finishing a novel. Possibly even volunteering if I can find the right position.

Basically when my partner gets a full time job we will be in a good financial position as he will earn a lot more than I am now (my income is pretty modest as I don’t have any degrees). The way I see it is it’s a chance to also study and better myself but she has said she “needs time to think about the future of our relationship” all because she says “you’re a misogynistic woman and setting women back 100 years” I don’t know how to make her see it from my perspective."

Like the title says, my ex boyfriend was murdered a couple of days ago. We were together for three years, and while things weren't always great, he was a really good guy. He had some issues which greatly contributed to our breakup. We remained on friendly terms after we split up, and he eventually overcame his issues. Sounded like he was getting his life back on track, which I was very happy to hear. 

I met my now husband pretty shortly after the breakup, and we've been married for almost four years now. We ran into my ex and his mom (who I was very close to while we were dating) just a few months ago. I introduced everybody, but it was definitely awkward, as would be expected. 

But yeah. There was a high profile crime in my area, and I was reading an article and saw my ex's name. It's a common name so I wasn't worried, but I messaged him just to check. Didn't hear anything. Read another article that included his middle name, age, and where he lived. It all matched. Went on his sister's Facebook, and all I saw were condolences. 

It was him.

I broke. Left work early, called my husband, called my parents. This just hits so hard. It feels weird hurting this much over an ex, and it's not like I'm not over him. Luckily my husband understands and said even he's sad, that the whole situation just sucks. It was, from what I've been able to find out, brutal and awful. I don't know how to handle this, and I feel uncomfortable talking about it too much with my husband.

Has anybody been through anything like this? How do you grieve for an important part of your past?

-------------
If that title don't get ya, nothin' will.

I know folks here have got some real heavy questions and I don't want to distract from their troubles, but I'd really like some advice on this.  Hopefully it won't be too long.

I live in the middle of nowhere in Texas.  Obviously it's a very conservative area.  I have a small bit of land and four horses.  One of my horses is a stallion who is only interested in my gelding.  I made a post about it on the horse forums [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/ap5mep/stallion_disinterested_in_mares_only_likes_gelding/).

After talking with some Reddit folks and my vet, it seems like this sort of thing isn't unheard of and we've ruled out any medical or behavioral issues.  I've just accepted that I have a gay horse and that's fine.

I jokingly mentioned this to my neighbor and he's not fine.

He went off on some crazy religious rant about how my horse is unnatural and a product of the devil and that I should put him down.  I said I'm not going to do that and he said he'd do it for me.  

I'm usually a very calm person, but I went off a bit on him and told him that if I caught him on my property, I'd put *him* down instead.  He said ""you won't catch me"".

I've been stressing out about it all week and have started keeping the stallion closer to the house so I can watch him, but he hates being in the barn alone and is so upset about the whole thing.  I've even spent a couple nights in the barn with him because I'm so scared that my neighbor is going to hurt him.

I can't call the police because I don't think it'd help.  I think they'd either blow it off, laugh at me, or agree with the neighbor.  I've also had a couple run ins with them because they think I'm an immigrant.  I know the neighbor has a cousin who is a cop too, but I'm not sure where.

I ordered a security light and camera for the paddock, but I don't know what else to do.

Even if they have shown no indication of it, and when you did your best to be pleasant? After a job interview I had today, I'm just dwelling on this presumption that the interviewers don't like me. But I can't really justify why. I feel the same way about a lot of people that I know. I just get the 'vibe' that they think of me a certain way.

For context, I am a 22yo female, studying at university and working. 

In some situations I have justification for why I think they don't like me, for example, my ex boyfriend made it his mission to tell all our mutual friends all the horrible things I allegedly did. 

In other situations, I may have only talked to the person a handful of times, but still feel they think I am slightly distasteful for reasons x, y and z - despite no reason for them to really think that.

Sometimes I even think my sisters don't like me, yet we talk every day.

Does anyone else feel like this? Why do you think this happens and how do I stop myself believing it so much?"

Should I have posted this update elsewhere? I am only posting here, because the original post was here.  So many, many people responded; I wanted to reach the same audience and let everyone know what their advice did, and the results.  The original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/9z2jff/my_brother_who_hated_religion_died_saturday_i/?utm_source=reddit-android

Some background:

In his last week of life, Brother was moved to our sister's house (who is an active nurse).  She selflessly accepted him in (despite two children and a work schedule that ICU/ER nurses have), and kept a ""baby monitor"" in the room; she was always available, cleaned him, turned him, etc... all of the needs that a dying person has, that only others whose family members are on the verge of dying can understand.

I followed the more or less general consensus, and was preparing to create a coalition to protest a funeral so very much against who my brother was in life.

And in my outrage... *I* somehow forgot who my brother was in life.

I got a call from our Sis.  She wanted to check up on me, knowing how devastated I was by Brother's death.

In all of my anger, in all of my outrage... I never called the one person who had been caring for him.

Brother foresaw our mother's pain, and agreed to a Roman Catholic burial.  He did not convert as I thought I was being told, or whatever the case may have been.

Sis did not believe it either, but assured me that she made sure they were alone, and spoke to him during a lucid period to verify that he actually agreed to it.

That was the kind of man my brother was.  In his very last days, as he lay dying, he cared more about how the pain and loss after he was gone would affect others, rather than about himself.

I actually *was* the asshole, for only dwelling in my own pain and not realizing that this is exactly something Brother would do: ""sacrifice"" himself for the good of others.  Sacrifice is too strong a word, but you know what I mean.

So:  I officially thank the hundreds upon hundreds who took the time to comment, and the dozens who PM'd/DM'd me.  All of you, in all of your thoughts and beliefs on every side... again, thank you.  Brother and I always believed in hearing all sides without reservation.

You have -beyond doubt- shown that that caring towards others still holds true despite all of the hate and fingerpointing that currently seems so prevalent.

A forum of complete strangers came together.  I love you all... and thank you so very, very much.

I have on last thing to ask of you:

Do a random act of kindness for a complete stranger, just once.

I don't mean some faceless donation to charity or whatever, to some random whatever.  Instead, make a difference, if even for a moment, to some other person around you.  For no reason other than to brighten someone's day.

Give a bag to someone who is short one at a checkout stand at your local grocery.  Offer to buy someone's coffee in line behind you. Help someone to cross a street, or offer to lead someone lost somewhere in a hospital. *Something*

Because these are the kind of things my brother did every day.  And if you happened to say -or even just think to yourself- ""Because Jeremy OB Wright no longer can, let me help you""... then there could never be any better memorial for him than that."

I care about her for sure but only knowing her for 2 months makes it difficult to not dislike her. How to deal? Hey everyone. Thanks for the great feedback. As I’ve already said in a few comments there has been some amazing feedback here. 

Looking back on it, this post came from a place of frustration. I understand her perspective and I just had a moment of weakness. 

When we said yes to having her here, we were straight out of the foster classes. Literally, just got the certification 2 days prior. But we still just... had a feeling that we could NOT say no when we were explained her dire situation. For everything she’s been through, which is a lot, she is doing great.  Just gets a little difficult for sure.  My wife has asked me if I regret saying yes and the answer is 100 percent no. Having her here has given this household some of this best times and that can’t be replaced. Does it get hard? Yes. But hearing her caseworkers say how much happier she seems when she is here and how much she has actually been able to be a kid... that stuff makes it worth it. The point of fostering quickly changes from wanting to make a difference to wanting to be HER difference. Sorry if this came across as me bitching or me not being prepared. You guys have been awesome and thanks for hearing me out. Advice definitely obtained. :)"

He is twice my size so I physically couldn't get him off me, not to mention I was drunk. I just kept saying no, stop, you're gay.

He went upstairs to sleep and I stayed downstairs until it was light enough to go home and ran home. This happened a week ago and I have been avoiding contact with him and kinda ignoring him.

Instead of running away from him I gathered his support system to find out what was wrong. If I hadn’t things could have turned out very badly. Link to the original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e3h5n7/my_best_guy_friend_did_something/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I don’t know if anyone will care but I think way things turned out in my situation is important. 

Tl:Dr E was in a mental health crisis. He didn’t need to be dropped, he was desperately clinging to his support system. 



When I made my initial post almost everyone said to drop E and run away from the whole situation. That felt wrong to me. Instead I got the people that he loves the most together to talk about his behavior. I didn’t think that someone who was reacting to things the way that he was could possibly be in a good mental state, and I was afraid for my friend. 

First, I contacted R and and him if he was actually interested in being romantically involved with me. He was. So we set up a time for the two of us, to sit down with E and his girlfriend to talk about why he got so angry seeing R and I together. 

It was a long conversation with lots of question dodging and tears, but in the end we started to unravel things a little bit. Here’s the basic summary:

E and R’s dad left their mom when they were both very young. He stayed in contact with them until he got married. E was 13 and hasn’t spoken to his father since then. E never received more than a few days of therapy for this. (And this is when he started having outbursts of anger).  They have another brother, L, who is a few years older than R. (Never mentioned him before because that original post was long enough and he was irrelevant). L became like a father figure to R and E after their actual dad cut contact. Then L got married about a year ago, and moved out off the house they lived in together, and became much more distant. Making E and R even closer. 

L didn’t leave entirely but E still felt like he lost a branch of his support system. Since L got married E’s mental health has been steadily getting worse. He was always prone to both anxiety attacks and depressive episodes in the past. Never diagnosed with anything officially because he wouldn’t go to a doctor, but when L became distant those things started getting much worse. E tried to keep it from everyone because he didn’t want anyone to worry. His girlfriend noticed a change, but E insisted to her that he was fine. 

You’re probably sensing a pattern in E’s life. Someone he cares about gets married, and stops being in contact with him. After some talking we found out that lots of E’s panic attacks are triggered by a fear (no matter how illogical) of losing people. 

After a long time insisting that we still loved him and we were there because we loved him, E finally told us why he freaked out at Friendsgiving.  When he saw R and I kiss he suddenly panicked, thinking that he was about to lose both his best friend and his brother to a relationship. In his mind the only way to keep us around was to make sure we didn’t date, and his reaction was the incident you read in the original post. 

E acknowledges that the way he acted was toxic, abusive,  and a bad way to handle the situation. He also said that he doesn’t mind if R and I date, and he doesn’t have romantic feelings for me. After much debate we finally convinced him to get a therapist and to stop drug use. To try it for at least for six months. He seems like he’s ready to get better. 

Overall I’m saying that while there is no hope in some situations you should still try to talk to people who are behaving erratically. There’s probably a reason they’re doing it. They may even know what the reason is. A cry for help doesn’t always sound like one. If your friends act in a way that is abnormal and negative, don’t immediately run away, try to help. If I had run away my best friend, who was already spiraling, would have been in a position that was so much worse."

Parents are mad at me for leaving before Xmas. Backstory:
My parents wanted me and my brother to stay at their house over night for Xmas eve. My girlfriend has trouble sleeping alone so I decided to take her with me for the night.

Now, my GF and my brother had had a weird relationship a while back and he was manipulative enough that she developed some strange tendencies about him, similar to that of an abusive relationship.

The Event: My GF and I are going to sleep. I pass out and wake up 15 minutes later to the sound of distant moaning. I get out of bed and the hair stands up on the back of my neck as I realize that my GF is not in my room. I sneak out into the hallway and I hear my GF giggling and laughing from my brothers room. I hear her whisper “be careful”.

I march straight into my brothers room where I find my brother pretending to be asleep (but still obviously breathing heavily) and my GF laying next to him. She still has her clothes on and she acts like nothing is going on but she’s being a little defensive.

I ask her what happened and she eventually admits that he had kissed her. She also later admits that she was moaning because he was touching her. She started off saying that she stopped him as soon as she could and that she only went in there to talk to him. I brought up that she could have left a lot sooner and that I could hear her moaning and she admired that she didn’t intend for things to get sexual, but she did let it happen because she still had feelings for him.

GF drove back home in the middle of the night and I soon did the same, sending my parents a quick heads up explaining why I left.

Present:
Now I’m getting texts from both my parents saying that they are sad that I left and that family should stick together. My mom said that she’s sorry I got caught up between my brother and GF which makes me feel like she didn’t respect my relationship with her and that it was always more about her and y brother.

They want me to hear my brothers side of the story. He has a history of using women and my parents usually respond with “he’s just not a relationship guy” even though he uses obvious manipulation tactics.

I really thought my parents would have my back on this one. Why does it feel like they care less about my situation and just want me to forgive my brother so we can have a normal Christmas?

What do I do?!

Update: Turns out my brother never made a move and she was the one trying to start shit. We’ve been together for almost a year now and I had no idea she was manipulating me the whole time. Feels like a mind-fucky plot twist at the end of a movie. My brain is inside out.

Final update:
I am absolutely dumping my GF. I recommended that she get psychiatric help because she shows some big signs of BPD. However, I also made it clear that what she did was unforgivable. No coming back from that.

It’s also apparent that both the GF and my brother were lying about what actually happened. There’s no reason for her to confess to messing around with him if it didn’t happen; odds are, my brother is lying about being innocent in the matter.

For my family’s sake, I will try to get along with him on holidays, but I absolutely do not trust him.

Thank you all for your support. It really means a lot to me. I never would have thought that this could happen to me and it’s honestly a bit surreal.

Also my now-ex got me a super nice espresso machine for Christmas and I sure as hell intend on taking it with me."

I work for an *amazing* company. I get paid *decently* well (though I live in one of the most expensive areas of the country, so it doesn't go very far).

But I really feel like I'm getting burnt-out. This morning in particular, I absolutely *despised* having to wake up and get ready. I didn't get much sleep, and because I'm forced to car-pool (ride with other people in the same car, so we can use HOV lanes) to work, I didn't have the option to show up late, or even take off work (well, I *could*, but it would be really crappy for them, plus I don't get much PTO to begin with).

I'm really starting to re-assess what I'm doing with my life.

Yes, I could absolutely stay with my company and one day retire. I make 60k/year and they do 50% uncapped match to my 401k, once I'm in a position to contribute. And I love the people I work with, and have absolutely no ill-will towards the company, other than my work-load being a bit heavy (in fairness, because of my team's salaries, the company is just barely breaking-even with us, as I understand it).

On the other hand... Jesus, this just doesn't feel like how humans are supposed to live. I'm gone 11 hours a day *minimum* (because of the commute, and no, moving closer to work is not an option, unless I was over half my salary going towards housing), and I feel completely exhausted *all the time*.

I basically don't leave my room anymore, because all I feel I have the energy for is either playing video games or going to sleep. It's a struggle just to force myself to go buy groceries or do ""grown-up"" shit.

I don't know what's missing. Maybe it's my perspective -- I think most people would probably kill to be in my position. But it honestly feels like time is just ticking by. All I do on the weekends is sleep, play games, or *occasionally* watch TV (which is rare, because I have roommates and I just don't like watching TV in the living room when they're around).

I don't want to do anything that's going to sabotage myself -- like quitting my job, just to wind up struggling to find minimum-wage work again, probably moving back in with my dad and his wife or something.

At the same time, though... I feel like my life is on a *very* specific track. And that track goes as follows: I continue working every day, I never meet anyone because I never go out and lack the time and energy to do so, and eventually I just die. I don't even think I'll make it to ""retirement"".

I cannot fathom anyone doing this shit, working 40+ hours a week, and thinking ""This is good enough"". As far as I'm concerned, I don't have any sort of ""life"". As the risk of sounding pretentious, I genuinely feel like a *slave*, that I lack any freedom to ""do what I want"". I don't even know *what* I want, but I lack the freedom to even explore the life around me."

I’m going to start with why this scenario even happened.

All my life, I was super feminine. Not in the way I dressed or acted, it was my body. I’m frail and small, and I probably have more estrogen in my body than testosterone. Whenever I transferred schools or had a new teacher, the teacher would always think a girl in my class do my work for me because even my handwriting was feminine. I was assigned a pen pal in foreign language class, and that pen pal was going to come to my school the next semester for foreign exchange. The teacher wanted us to write to that person to get to know them before they came. That pen pal thought I was a girl until they asked, four letters later because they were “attracted to me.” My unisex name doesn’t help. Because of my femininity, people made fun of me for it. Harassed me constantly. Even my friends joke and call me their “girlfriend.” And a few days before the assault happened, I found out some boys had a sexual fantasy about me, especially cause at the time my hair was a bit longer, just touching my chin, and was dyed blue and purple. They thought because I had a feminine hairstyle means I’m asking for it. Apparently, a lot of the boys in my high school have trap fantasies. 

Anyway, you get the jist. Here’s what happened.

I was at a friend’s 16th birthday party. I started talking to this guy (M18) and we were just slightly tipsy. I’m bicurious, so I thought I might as well explore my sexuality since he’s already getting handsy. Plus, I trusted him. He thought my femininity didn’t matter, and people are just creepy. We eventually were in the guest room, and to put it bluntly, he was jerking me off. That part was consensual. Everything was going okay until I heard snickers in the room. The room was completely dark, and you couldn’t see a thing. I thought it was nothing, and it was just the guy I was with. Then it happened again. It sounded like a female, two females. I tell the guy to stop, there’s someone else in the room. He didn’t respond. I yelled at him to stop, and kneed him in the face. At this point, I knew there were four people in the room but I didn’t know who, because there were only four voices that seemed familiar but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. I tried to get my pants on and leave the room, but the guy pinned me down. I don’t remember exactly what he was whispering in my ear, but it was always along the lines of “stay still” or “were just gonna have some fun” and trust me, I was freaked out. I tried to do everything I could to get him off me, but he was stronger. He didn’t realize he was raping me, because he did everything he could to make me “feel good.” Surprise, just because you use lube doesn’t mean it won’t hurt them. And while I was crying and telling him to stop, those four people just watched. I think one even took a flash picture. After he was done, they left me there, door wide open and turned he lights on so if anyone walked in on me, they would think I’m some creep and kick me out. But, no one walked in. I was just laying there. After an hour or two, I got dressed and left the party. I walked home even though it hurt to take every step.

When it was school again on Monday, I figured out who those four people were. My good friend told me that those four people who I thought were my friends/acquaintances told a lot of people what happened and they pretended that I was a slut and wanted it, and I put on a “show” for all of them. No one believes I was raped besides that one good friend.

What do I do?

TL;DR- Taking advantage of my femininity, a person raped me and four people watched and told everyone."

I was the last one against the entire enemy team and I won the round for my team and they still voted to kick me.

I get that its PlayStation and people are gonna be mean, but when I play with my brother they are always nice to him. I honestly started believing the things my ex said to me are true.

I need advice on how to find good home for cats. We currently have nine cats. *Nine*. I cannot take it anymore. We burn through cat food, which has to be an expensive brand because of my roommate's cat and its bowel problems. The house and my clothes are constantly covered in hair. It always smells in here. My furniture is forever ruined. One of the little buggers always has diarrhea and goes outside of the box. Another one likes to spray on everything even though he is fixed.

I am sick of it. When we moved into this house, a little less than two years ago, we had three cats, one of which came along with the property. That's a lot, but manageable. We then asked a friend to move in and he brought along his two cats. Five. Okay, that's a little too many, but I wasn't being driven insane, yet. 

Then we bring in two stray kittens that are now adults. Then a cat shows up and my girlfriend mistakenly brings it in, but instead of putting it back out immediately she puts up a fight about how the cat belongs to *someone* and we need to shelter it from the incoming severe weather. I went to sleep pissed, but I actually expected her and my roommate to make an effort of finding that cat's home, instead of going to two houses and calling it quits. Then, another cat. 

Here I am. Overwhelmed by cats. I am tired of it. I'm ready to find five cats good homes. I do not want to take them to a shelter, but I am not opposed to it. We managed to give away an entire litter within a month, but that was cute little kittens. This will be harder, and I need some good advice so that I can finally find peace. I want out of this kitty cat hell."

Should I report this to the police? Male, 24, United States

Around a week ago, a landscaping company had cut my internet cable by accident while they were working on the lawn around my complex.  Thus, our line was disconnected and we did not have service.  I went to Suddenlink to get it fixed and they came out around a week later and replaced the cord.  Later that night, my internet went out again and we were wondering why.  I went outside and a neighbor whom I don't really communicate with said that whoever replaced my cable had also disconnected his line.  Thus, he rectified the problem by disconnecting my line an plugging his back in.  

Is this a situation that I should get the police involved?  Given that he did not work for the company and had no right to do what he did, he was definitely in the wrong.  However, I am not entirely sure if this is illegal.  Would the police even be able to help in this situation?


Edit (Update 1):  Bear with me because this might take a while.  After the confrontation with my neighbor, my girlfriend and I went to bed with plans to go to Suddenlink so that they might fix our internet again.  When I went to my vehicle in the morning, I found that someone had broken into both my car and my gf's car.  There didn't seem to be any signs of forced entry (we probably left our vehicles unlocked like some dummies) and nothing was stolen.  Obviously someone had gone through our stuff but did not take anything.  They did remove my backpack with library books and threw it into my front yard (if one can even call the grass in front of my apartment a ""yard"").  They didn't take anything out of the bag but did leave all of the zippers open.  We filed a police report and mentioned the altercation we had with our neighbors.  My gf thinks that the guy had broken into our car but I know that there are crazy people at our complex.  Plus, I wanted to give our neighbors the benefit of the doubt.  However, I thought I should mention it to the police regardless. 

Flashforward to today.  The Suddenlink guy came out to fix our internet.  This time it was some other person who shall go nameless.  They fixed our internet and the box itself so that it locked properly.  After he left, our internet was back on.  About fifteen minutes later, it cut off completely.  Familiar with this problem, we went out to see if our neighbor had disconnected our line.  Sure enough, he had.  This time, he LITTERALLY cut our line.  We confronted him and he was obviously angry and even admitted to cutting the line.  He was pretty unkind to us and we decided to file a police report and call the company back (luckily the guy who worked on our box gave us his number).  The company has also filed a report with the police. The cable guy came back and fixed the problem, this time for good.  I have no idea if our neighbor's internet is out now and frankly do not care.  We have reported him to the police and our landlords as this is technically destruction of property, even if it is not our property.  If anything changes after this, I will post additional updates."

We’ve decided to keep her. What do I need to know about raising a small kitten? tl;dr: rescued a 6wk old kitten and decided to keep her with us and our 6 year old cat, they get along, she eats drinks poops and pees just fine, she has mites or fleas or something and she’s going to the vet today to get an assessment and a work up. I’ve never had such a young cat although I’ve had many before - what do I need to know or do differently for her?

Long story: I was going to my car after being in a store for a few minutes and heard a squeaking sound and there was a kitten under my tire. at first I thought I’d crushed her but under further inspection she was just huddled against it because it was warm.

I immediately panicked, got my blanket out of the car and wrapped her in it and drove home. I’ve never had a cat this small but I have had several cats and kittens, and we have a 6 year old cat now so I figured it would be good to dry her off, brush her, warm her up and then we immediately took her to the vet. They were about to close but they were able to sex her, estimate her age, weigh her, and schedule an appointment for later today so we can get her assessed and give her shots.

She’s 6 weeks old, weighs 1.4 pounds, is female and isn’t observably sick...just terrified and cold. We went and got some kitten supplies and went home. Upon further inspection when we got home she has mites or fleas so we gave her a bath with flea shampoo, then quarantined her with some wet food, water, the carrying case we took her to the vet in, and her own litter box. 

Despite a moderate amount of fleas and being stuck in the freezing rain for who knows how long, she has a good amount of energy and played with us some. We were able to clip her nails, she used the litter box for both functions, and otherwise just coddled her all night.  

Between her and the big kitty there was some hissing at first but by the morning time they were amiable. He groomed her and pet her a little bit. He’s always done well with other cats and animals, so I’m not concerned. She doesn’t appear to be fazed by him, just a small and very...not-intimidating hiss so he’ll respect her space.

I’ve never had a cat this young or had 2 cats with such an age gap. I’m anxious to go to the vet and learn more from a professional what our next steps are but what can we do in the mean time? What do you suggest?"

I was raped.

I (mid 30s male) was raped when I was 12 years old, by my older male cousin. He took me to the attic to show me playboys, and then insisted we “practice”. He penetrated me.

I’ve been increasingly suffering anxiety around sex. I dont know why it is manifesting only now after so many years. I feel the walls close in on me, my heart races to the point it hurts, I tremble and break out in cold sweats.

It has taken me 20 years to tell someone. I told my wife today, who I have known for 15 years, dated for 10, and have been married for the last 5. When I told her, I still couldn’t show emotion, I couldn’t feel emotion, and only once she hugged me and then took our daughter to take a bath did I break down crying.

I dont know what to do. I dont know who to talk to. I am a strong, beardly, tattoo’d man. I know my outward appearance shouldn’t effect how I deal with this…. But the stigma around being a male victim of rape is… daunting.

I think I am finally ready to talk to someone. But I dont know who. Who is qualified to deal with this? What type of therapist? Shrink? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?

Sincerest apologies if this is not the thread for this kind of advice.

Thank you

EDIT: There are so many wonderful comments. I do not know where to start. I try typing to reply to most of you, but i stop myself. I have cried more in the past 24 hours than i think I have in my life. I am so grateful for everyones kindness.

You all have given me some wonderful resources. I am in contact with RAINN, I am getting a few appts set up with a therapist. Someone recommended a book, Courage to Heal, just primed that one.  And the internet hugs, so kind.

I couldnt't bring myself to talk about it more with my wife, but she is giving me the patience and time i need to process this at my speed. She has been very kind and caring. Someone mentioned to make sure i watch how she responds, and i do appreciate that. I cannot recede into myself and forget her emotions as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try and respond to more of you. But if i dont, please know its not because i didnt find your comments helpful.

Hi, it‘s me again. First of all, thanks for all the help &amp; support. I‘m still shocked how much attention I got and how many people cared for me. So many people decided to actually help me and not just to ignore me. Also, some people also told my english is perfect. These people literally made my day! Thank you guys so much!
On the other hand, many people wrote something like „Your father deserves to die“ , „Your sister deserved that slap“ etc... That‘s just so wrong. That‘s not helping me at all, that’s just making me sad!

I decided to have a little talk with my family about what happend and about the current situation of my sister. My parents agreed with almost everything I said and they started to realize things. They told me what they did was wrong and they shouldn’t have put me under pressure. They took my sisters phone away and they paid a tutor to teach her. Maybe my sister isn’t happy with that, but I am. It‘s just better for us all.

I looked in the eyes of my father. I saw how bad he felt during all this. My father isn’t a bad parent or an aggressive father, normally he‘s so calm. That’s why I respect him. I think this time he was just scared about my sister and started to randomly destroy everything near him, because my father is a very caring person and that’s the first time I saw him freaking out. Anyways, after that he came in my room and we had a little talk alone without my sister or my mother.

He came in and said „Holy shit, did I do this mess? My god...“. I started to laugh and he began laughing too. He told me that he was so sorry and he would never do things like that. Then he hugged me. My father hugged me many times, but this time it was special. He didn’t really mention anything about my stuff and my birthday but I‘m ok with that. Atleast I already got my birthday present: My family is happy again.

_Thanks for all the support. This is now my favorite sub on Reddit. I love you, r/Advice because your community made me and so many other people happy again. &lt;3_

No matter how much I work, no matter what hobbies I have, no matter how many friends I have, when I go home and lie in bed I just feel lonely, when will it end? I know it's a tail you've heard a billion times. I've had few relationships and relatively very little in terms of a sex life, I can't pursue it because then I am desperate and depressed, but if I don't pursue it nothing proactively changes. I just never feel good enough. And yes I know I must love myself. Well idk really what that entails, I know who I am, I enjoy my qualities and think I'm a decent person. Yet even so I still feel alone and weighed down by that lonliness, if I'm such a great person who can love myself, why cant I have that with another person. God I'm rambling sorry.

Update: wow this got alot more response than I ever expected. And I'm grateful. Ultimately I know it's about working on myself and loving myself and letting possible relationships happen naturally. I guess it just feels like all the fighting to improve myself has yielded minor results at best, but I know I can't stop pushing. I'll update again at some point. Thank you for the advice everyone."

This is a throwaway account that I made a few months ago when my wife was diagnosed, because I needed to vent, but I chickened out and didn't post.

My wife of 24 years was diagnosed with motor neuron disease (referred to as ALS or MND depending on where you live) in August of 2019. The average survival time from diagnosis is 3 years, however, my wife has progressed rapidly and her symptoms now match someone who typically has just months to live.

She can no longer walk, talk, feed herself, wipe her own bottom etc and she struggles to swallow food and breathe comfortably. She's already given up and come to terms with what's coming, but I can't even begin to let go.

Currently, I'm snowed under with the day to day of looking after her and, mercifully, the busy routine doesn't give me time to stop and think about it too much, but something someone said to me today made me realise that at some point I'm really going to be without her and when that happens, when all the activity stops, I'm not sure what's next .. I have no clue. I feel like the normal reaction will be to shut down and feel sorry for myself for a long time. Maybe some advice from someone who's been where I am now could help.

If you've been where I am now, I'd appreciate hearing anything - especially the 'gotchas' - the things that you had no idea would happen, and how you dealt with it.

One final word: As is often the case with posts like this they get upvoted and gilded etc. This is a throwaway account, so I don't care about upvotes, other than wanting more people to see this and hopefully the right person sees it and says something that helps. As for gilding etc .. please don't. If you feel moved by our predicament and you really feel like it, instead, take a minute and find a reputable charity or research organisation in your part of the world that is trying to cure MND/ALS and donate $10. If all that comes of this is that I get some useful advice and a scientist somewhere gets some more money to do research, that's fine with me.

Thanks for listening, I'm off to try and get some sleep.

** EDIT: Wow thank you all. Such kind words. I'm in tears reading all these. I'll answer some of the questions here as I don't think I'll have time to answer each one until later tonight.

Re Help:   
Our only nearby family are my parents. They come once a week and help out with laundry, cleaning and so on.

We have carers come to our house for a few hours each day. More would be nice, but our finances and my wife's disability allowance don't give us much more than that.

We also have some equipment on loan from a motor neurone associate here. Wheelchair, shower/toileting equipment, a hoist to lift her between bed, wheelchair etc.

A few people asked if I've considered therapy. I haven't, to be honest. Probably because the workload of look after my wife is so high I don't have time to do much else.

There are more things I should say here but I have to go right now. I'll try to get back on later tonight when she's sleeping and respond directly to replies."

The doctor lost the suturing needle (it was embedded into my wife’s vagina) and it took us 2 weeks to realize something was wrong. The doctor gave my wife the green light to go home from the hospital but after 2 weeks of my wife being in excruciating pain, we were to the point of believing that this pain was not normal post child birth pain. I had my wife lie down so I could take a look (I would have sooner, but my wife was in a lot of pain and we thought it was normal recovery pain). Low and behold, a sharp silver shiny object sticking out of my wife. I ran her to the ER (it was Sunday and the doctors office was closed) to get the needle taken out. The ER doc was bewildered that this happened and he called our doctor’s personal phone to tell her what happened. She never contacted us to talk about it and did nothing to try remedy it. We weren’t planning on pressing charges, but we were firm that we were not going to pay for the ER visit. My wife went in for her 6 week check up and brought up the whole fiasco and the doctor said to her in person that she would take care of the ER visit and that we should pay anything. Well fast forward to today and turns out she never paid it and now we have a debt collector calling us on behalf of the hospital. Any advice?



UPDATE:
Thank you all so much for the support and advice! I am overwhelmed by the comments and feel very validated by my feelings of anger and frustration. My wife and I are gathering all of the information we can and are still discussing with each other exactly which order we are going to go about this. I truly wish I could post a picture in this sub to show you the needle, but I will link it to Imgur https://imgur.com/yz1wn5L (if that is against the rules I can remove the link). My wife insisted that she got a picture of it as well as the board in the ER room that had the attending's name as well as the nursing staff. It was basically the entire needle, so I'm still baffled that the doc lost it in the first place. I will update again in the coming days!"

my mind against him. I spent years being sexually/physically assaulted, raped, kicked out, &amp; emotionally abused. I believe none of this would have happened had she not kidnapped me. Unsure on options. **TRIGGER WARNING: graphic discussion on child abuse, sexual assault, physical assault, emotional abuse, kidnapping.**

X-posted to /r/legaladvice and /r/advice.

**TL;DR as short as I can get it: On March 5th, 2020, I learned that my mother basically kidnapped me and my sister from our father around 1990-ish, drove us from Arizona to Kansas, and spent our childhood dodging his every attempt to be a father. My stepfather's son raped me for two years around 1987-ish, my stepfather sexually assaulted me (unknown for just how long) until I turned him in to the police in the summer of 1994. I didn't realize until 2010-ish that my mother not only knew about the abuse, she wanted to stay with my stepfather and she participated in the abuse. And now I've only just learned that, between 1984-ish to 1990-ish, my mother kept us from my father at all costs before kidnapping us and moving us from Arizona to Kansas. It is my belief that, had she never kept us from our father, I could have never endured all of the abuse I went through. I'm quite certain I have no legal recourse on the assaults because statute of limitations may have passed long ago. But do I have any options for legal justice? Prison time for my mother? A Lawsuit against my mother?**

Following is the timeline of events that I now know:

**Circa 1972:** My future birth mother met my future birth father. She wanted him so badly that she was willing to do anything to get him. So, she had her wealthy parents buy him a car to drive her around in and she did everything she could to trap and control him. My mother also started accusing my father of cheating on her. This accusation persisted throughout the full length of their relationship and it was deflection to cover up her cheating on him throughout their entire relationship.

**1972:** My mother and father were 16 and got pregnant. They both had their parents grant them permission to get married at 16 and my mother's father arranged for them to go on their ""honeymoon"" to Florida. That honeymoon was a disguise for the abortion that my grandfather arranged and paid for. (I already knew most of this info, but not the part about my grandfather being involved or that it was disguised as their honeymoon.)

After this, my mother moved from South Bend, Indiana, to the Phoenix, Arizona, metro with my father and his family (mother, adoptive father, and siblings). I am unclear on if she finished high school because she did want to drop out, but I think she gave up that idea and finished school.

**1972-1982:** My mother and father lived a life of luxury bought and paid for by my mother's father. He bailed her out of every situation, as well as buying them houses, cars, and vacations, and making whatever arrangements she needed. Then, at some point around 1982, my mother demanded to have children. She fought and fought with my father and his family, telling them she had this perfect timeline of her life that she had lined out. They tried to convince her that it's going to be hard to transition from the carefree lifestyle to a family one, but she demanded. Apparently, she got everything she ever demanded.

**March 1982:** My parents had me.

**November 1984:** My parents had my little sister. My sister was apparently constantly crying, screaming, and thrashing as a baby, and my mother was always pissed that she wouldn't stop. It was at this time she began to scream at my father and tell him that his supposed drug use was the reason my sister wouldn't stop. My mother claimed my sister was going through ""withdrawals"" because she was no longer being fed drugs like she was in utero. (I think we all know the science doesn't back up my mother's claim and that any drug withdrawals my sister might have had would have been because her mother was abusing drugs while pregnant.)

It was sometime around 1984 that my mother began cheating on my father with the man who later became my stepfather. She had been accusing my father of cheating and he got tired of being accused for something he wasn't doing, so he figured he might as well cheat on her. He cheated with the woman who became his second wife and mother to his son.

One month after my parents' divorce was final, my mother married my stepfather — the man she'd been cheating on my father with. This entire timeline of events from before my sister was born to after my mother was remarried is still foggy. I know what happened, just not the particular order of when my mother got pregnant and when she met my stepfather.

**1985-1990:** I have zero cohesive memories from this time in my life. There's flashes of things, but that's it. Flashes pertain to me being woken up in the middle of the night by one of my stepfather's much older sons who lived with us for two years and who raped me during that time. There's flashes of him making me hide in his closet at night or making me go to the bathroom with him. There's flashes of parents yelling, screaming, and physically fighting. There's flashes of my mother separating my older stepsister from my younger sister because she was inappropriately touching my little sister in the blanket forts we made. There's all these bad flashes, but there's absolutely no happy memories from this time.

During the time, my father was supposed to see my little sister and me every other weekend. He was paying child support, doing everything he had to do by the court's order, and was trying to have a relationship with us kids. My mother continually fought him and told him he couldn't see us and we would conveniently not be home when it was my father's time to pick us up. This persisted for years, bringing my father to the decision to stop paying support for kids he never saw. My mother took him to court and he was forced to pay. So, after that, she proceeded to take him to court every year for more money. My father also apparently carried insurance on us.

**1990(ish):** My mother and stepfather packed everything up and moved us from Arizona to Kansas without court approval or my father's knowledge. She just up and stole us, and he didn't find out until it was yet again another weekend he was supposed to have us. He showed up at the house and literally everything was gone and the house was for sale.

**1992-1994(ish):** It was somewhere during this time that, according to my memory, my stepfather began sexually and physically assaulting me. He would make me shower with him. He would interrupt me running bath water and make me sit on his lap while I was naked and tell him about my day. My mother was even home plenty of times when this happened and I remember going to her for help many times, but every time I asked her to stop him she told me ""He's your father. He loves you. And he would never hurt you."" When I took things into my own hands and started locking the bathroom door, my mother and stepfather would nearly beat the door down while screaming at me to unlock the door and let them in. Every single time I got scared enough and let them in, they would drag me to their bedroom, throw me on their bed, and proceed to ""spank"" me all up my back, across my butt, and down my thighs. I would be red, swollen, welted, and even bruised or bleeding on many, many occasions.

**March 10th, 1994:** My older stepsister and I celebrated our birthdays together for the last time.

**April 20th, 1994:** My older sister shot herself with her stepfather's gun. Years later one of her friends exposed that she had left a suicide note that explained why. She had been being raped by her father (my stepfather) as long as she could remember.

**Summer 1994:** My stepfather sexually assaulted me while my mother was supposedly at work. He thought I was asleep. He came into my room naked. He knelt down by my bed. He pulled up my night shirt and pulled down my underwear. He assaulted me in ways he had never previously done before. While pretending to be asleep, my flight or fight response kicked in and I pretended like I was getting restless and was going to wake up. He freaked out, re-situated my clothes, left the room, and went into my little sister's room. I heard this, so I repeated my actions, but louder and even kicked our shared wall. He left her room, went into his room, got dressed, and went outside.

It was at this time that I woke my sister up and told her to get ready ASAP because we were going to leave. I tried calling my mother's work, doctor's office, friends, and anyone I could think of, but no one knew where she was. So, my sister and I ran over to the neighbors. I told the neighbors everything and they called the police for us. They even stayed with us at the sheriff's office the entire day because even the cops couldn't find my mother.

By the end of the day, they finally found my stepfather and mother. He had come back to the house and told the cops it was my friend Wendy's stepfather who sexually assaulted me, not him. That was 100% false because I visually identified him as he was leaving my room from the assault. As for my mother, she had been at a friend's house all day. (It wasn't until years later that those friends informed me that she had been confessing to them that she knew my stepfather was sexually assaulting me and that she should stop it, but she didn't want to risk losing the ""perfect life"" she created for herself.)

The police told my mother to file charges, get a protection order for us kids, and to divorce him. She told me she wasn't pressing charges against him because she ""didn't want to put me through the pain of a trial."" (Again, she didn't want to leave him in the first place, so it came to me surprise that she didn't want to press charges. These days, the state would press charges regardless of how she felt.)

After the final sexual assault — and as I was dealing with this while going through the confusion of puberty — my mother insisted that I sleep with her in her bed. I fought her. I didn't want to do this because it made me uncomfortable. What I wanted didn't matter and I was forced to sleep with my mother for some time. She would even spoon me and make me spoon her. I became her defacto husband.

**1995-2000:** My mother spent years hitting me, grounding me, publicly humiliating me, kicking me out of my house and changing the locks, and then forcing me to move back home for more torment. During this time I lived at 1) a local hospital's mental unit, 2) United Methodist Youthful Center (once a home for abandoned and homeless kids), 3) neighbors, 4) my mother's parents' house, 5) my birth father's (who my mother had spent my life convincing me that he was the bad guy in all of this), 6) a friend's house, and 7) a boyfriend's grandparents' house.

It was during this time that I was cutting myself, drinking, smoking, doing drugs, and letting boyfriends do whatever they wanted to my body on public display because it was all I believed I was good for. I spent every day wishing I was dead, but unable to do it myself. I wanted someone, anyone to kill me. I didn't care what happened before or after, I just wanted them to end my suffering.

**2000-2007(ish):** I tried desperately to have a relationship with my mother, thinking that maybe she would want and love me now that I wasn't the awful child she told me I was. Nothing worked and I spent these years beating myself up for being a failure who couldn't even get her own mother to love her.

Towards the end of this timeframe, I finally realized I could never satisfy my mother because it wasn't me that was broken, it was her. (Though, I was not convinced I wasn't a bad person. Decades of gaslighting me led me to firmly believe I was, am, and always will be broken.) I cut my mother out of my life and started to try heal.

**2019-2020:** I've been in therapy with the most incredible therapist I could ever imagine. She has truly helped me get on a path of self-healing which I'm certain will eventually lead to self-acceptance and self-love. But all of this takes a lot of time and a lot of hard work. Some days it's too much.

**March 2nd-5th, 2020:** I learned just how evil my mother was, is, and always has been. Gaps in my life were finally starting to be filled in with stories that fit the profile I had for my mother. Questions that had always been unanswered were starting to get answers. I was thrilled and excited because I was finally, for the first time in my life, being validated and vindicated.

**March 6th-12th, 2020:** All of the new information collapsed in on me. I suddenly realized that I could have never endured all that abuse and pain if only she never kidnapped me. That's the part that been killing me.

**March 13th, 2020-Present Day:** I am stabilizing. I've talked with my doctor, therapist, partner, and a few friends. **And now I'm trying to figure out what recourse I have, what lawyers or victim's rights organizations can help me, and how I can find justice after all these years.**

**I'm almost certain I can't do anything about my mother doing nothing about the physical and sexual abuse I went through — including from her own hands — because there would be a statute of limitations. But I only just learned about the kidnapping which seems to me is what really kicked off the years of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse I endured. There has to be something I can do about that! This is new information. The statute of limitations couldn't possibly be expired on new information, right?**

**So, please, I'm begging you. Is there is a way to find justice? Bigger than me, are there organizations or politicians that I can contact in order to work on new laws to better protect victims of childhood assault who often don't learn the truth of their past until much later in life? I never want another human to experience what I have.**

Thanks. I know that was a lot."

There's no sound on the video for me to know what the context of the video, and I don't remember this happening, like at all. I only know when this was because of my hair colour/length in the video, and the fact I'm wearing glasses. The words I can determine I'm saying by lip reading are ""my mum"", and ""school"". 

What can I do? This video was taken approximately 3 and a half years ago. And suddenly this person finds my email and sends me the video? To purposely make me feel uncomfortable? What can I do?"

My friends and I are trying to think of something to get her for Christmas to try and make up for how shitty her year has been. Does anyone have any suggestions for what to get her?

One of my closest friends is making a hand written note, and some of my other friends are making cookies and buying a bouquet of flowers.
Thank you to everyone that commented your suggestions, we're giving her the gifts this friday. I'll update this post when we give them to her.)

(That was one of the most wholesome things I've ever seen. Things went even better than I expected. So we decided to give her the gifts after class, and to make sure she didn't leave immediately after class, we had most of us stay behind while the rest of us went to grab the stuff. There was like three bags worth of stuff; chocolate, flowers, stuffed animals, you name it. We all gathered around it because my teacher wanted to take a picture. She didn't cry like a couple of us had predicted, but she did give quite a few students hugs. All in all, it made me feel super happy to see her smile again after what originally happened.
P.S. rumor has it that the main trouble maker in class is getting kicked out of the class next semester.
Again thank you all so much for your suggestions)

The human body has become sexually neutral to me. Do you think this is normal? Is there anything I should do different about it? I remember when I was a teenager, just a picture of a naked Pam Anderson was enough to get me going for days. The fact that she had big fake canonball tits didn't bother me at all. Nothing really did. Everything was exciting.

But as the years have gone on, I find I am impressed less and less. This has likely been exacerbated by my training and job as a doctor. I have now over the past 10 years seen and done things medically to so many people that likely go beyond the scope of what any normal person outside of my field or perhaps a sex worker would experience in their life span.

This goes for both men and women's bodies. 

There was a time giving a rectal/prostate exam to a man would make me mildly uncomfortable. Now I've stuck my finger in so many people's asses of both genders it's pretty much a completely neutral experience. Not much different than listening to a heartbeat.

I've seen thousands of people in various states of undress. 

I've done countless manual pelvic exams on women to feel for pelvic muscle dysfunction, infections, cervix abnormalities, and ovarian masses. I've done so many speculum exams for paps I couldn't begin to count. Ditto with breast exams.

I know what the spectrum of human anatomy looks and feels like inside and out from birth to 90 years old and everywhere between.

I know people would probably like to believe this isn't the case,  but when you start out in this type of field you're not machine-like. There was a time even the notion of doing a breast exam made my heart beat a bit faster. The first pap I did my heart was pounding so much just from nervousness and also I hadn't really seen many women naked at all at that time. Now it's literally just tissue to be sorted through and analyzed. The only nervousness I have now is if I will be making the person I'm examining uncomfortable or not.

The neutralization of the body in my mind probably makes me more ideal as a doctor. Most people would like a doctor who sees them as a neutral body. But I think it's changing my perspective on dating and sex too. Porn has become boring. Masturbation is boring. Dating is boring.

I was out at a club grinding with a girl and while my dick got hard from it, that was really just an involuntary response. I didn't really actually care the whole time. I kept thinking she needed to lose 10 lb as I felt her hips because (1) all I do all day is try to find and analyze physical flaws and what people can do to be healthier and (2) I've seen and been around so much it's almost impossible for anyone to really be impressive to me physically.

I remember when I was a resident working in a breast clinic, one of the husbands of a patient made a joking comment about how it must be an amazing job to just feel up women's breasts all day. I think that's how other men might see it. But that's not the reality at this point. For example, I calculated and I will have to do over 40 hours of paps (which often also include a breast exam as that is the most opportune time to screen both) in the next 2-3 months to catch up my patient population for the year. It's literally just a chore that will eat into the rest of my schedule and it's going to be a grind to get them all booked in and done.

How do you get excited about sex or dating when the human body has literally become just a chore to you?

It seems to me like you can't have it both ways. If the human body is exciting and new then you're not the objective and neutral doctor people want. And once you've seen so much it becomes boring then how do you excited about it again?

I guess maybe this is just an inevitable change that occurs from doing this sort of thing. I really don't know. I just know it's hard to get excited about dating or sex when almost nothing excites you anymore. I kind of miss the days when the body was an exciting and uneasy thing. That uneasiness is where sexual tension, fantasy, and desire comes from.

How do you have those things once the mystery is pretty much completely gone?"

So here’s the story. When I was 17 my uncle started messaging me online and responding to my photos, he’d send me fire emojis and heart eyes. I thought this was weird and spoke to my mom about it who then told me not to worry. On my 18th birthday he told me he was so happy I was 18, but again, I thought nothing of it because my mom told me not to. For the next year it continued with him sending me emojis and I’d reply because, well, he’s my uncle.

Then one day he got ahold of my Snapchat and as weird as I thought it was, I accepted his request. He’d send me regular snapchats of his day-to-day life and I would typically reply with smiley face emojis, never really starting up conversation because I just felt as though something was off.

Flash forward, I got my first nude. I skipped through the Snapchat so quickly that I convinced myself I had imagined it. Then came the videos. Disgusting videos of him touching himself and moaning my name. I went to my mom and (not surprising considering my family) she didn’t believe me and said I would need proof before she believed me.

I screenshotted all of the photos he sent to me that very night and showed my mom, who made excuse after excuse about how somebody must have photoshopped the photo and was pretending to be my uncle. When I convinced her it was real, she told my aunt and the two went to confront him. I don’t know what happened the night they both confronted him but my mom came home that night telling me that I needed to forgive him and move on because he is family, and it wasn’t as if he touched me or raped me.

This weekend is Easter, and although I have not had too much contact with my family since the incident, they expect me to be there for Easter. They have invited my uncle and it disgusts me. I do not want to see him however, although I do not live with my mom she helps support me when I can’t afford my bills and I’m afraid she will stop if I don’t show up to Easter. I don’t know what to do.

I also don’t know what can be done about my uncle seeing as I was 18 when the photos were sent to me. I need advice because I am stressing over Easter and don’t know if I can handle seeing my uncle or my family who is unsympathetic to how I feel."

[Please look at this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/clzgkk/update_my_mom_sold_my_dog_against_my_will_and_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) 


[SMALL UPDATE BELOW]

I’m 16yo, male.
I had an amazing, very well behaved one year old Akita dog that I spent basically the whole day with...she was pretty protective of me, and she was large. Although she was an angel with amazing behavior, and whenever my family came to interact with her, she was pretty nice although they didn’t stick around much...only interacting with her for a few minutes before leaving, I was basically the only person taking care of her, but I loved it, and I loved her.

Then my mom told me she wants to sell my dog. She said it was way too large and scary looking and she wanted a dog that “could be compared to a cat, and treated like one”.  I had no choice in the matter and a week later, my dog was gone. A lady came to pick her up and I had the task of crating her and such...I put my dog in the lady’s car, and she and my mom went inside to discuss some stuff. I ran to the kitchen and got some boiled chicken, the treat I usually give her. I sat in the ladys car with my dog for a bit, giving her plenty of chicken and petting her with my fingers through the bars of the crate, so she wouldn’t be scared on the car ride as much...


Then, when mom and the lady came back and the lady drove off, my dog was gone.
I didn’t really feel anything. I was just kinda like...I guess another dog it is...

A week passed, and I was actively just waiting for a new dog. It felt so weird not having anything to take care of. Of course, I did miss my dog...but I didn’t feel sad, I was just feeling “void”, nothing. If that makes sense.

Mom came home with a new three month old small puppy, a white terrier. About a week has passed since I owned him, and I’m his primary caretaker.  Of course, I love him and he’s been a sweetheart, although needing a lot of training that I’m working on at the moment..but my family has been wanting him with them a lot more than my old dog. They sometimes come to me and tell me to leave the dog with them for a bit, all of my family call him cute when he does certain things. He’s...scarily similar to my Akita dog in the way he acts. But instead of freezing up or being indifferent to his actions like they were with my Akita, they call him cute n stuff...even though he’s acting very similarly to my old Akita, he’s just small and non-threatening I guess. But I would get this very irriater feeling in my gut when I see how my family treats this dog so differently even when my Akita did the same thing...you know, jumping in excitement, micro borks when playing, running around excitedly, being happy to see me, standing, dog stuff. 

The more time I spent with this dog, the more he just kept reminding me of my Akita. I’ve been getting more and more depressed just thinking ahout it while I’m taking care of him since he reminds me so much of her...


One day, I was trying to get my new dog to sleep. I was in my room and he was on his bed, but he was being very anxious and hasn’t slept well. I was determined to make him sleep at least a little that day. I knew he trusted me, so I just did some stuff. Played relaxing music, sat with him silently while he slept, comforted him, a lot of stuff. Still, though, he’d suddenly jerk awake every 15 minutes or so at the slightest sound, and then he would see me, I’d pet him and he’d almost immediately plop down to sleep. This kept reminding me when I was doing the same thing to my Akita dog when she was anxious and didn’t sleep at all for a whole day almost...She was waking up at each sound, just like this new dog was, and the way I was treating this new dog to get him to sleep was exactly what I did to my Akita. 


So I was theee, literally just sitting there in silence making sure he actually gets to sleep. He’d wake up every 15 minutes. All the while, I’m silently just...being reminded of my Akita. I was holding back tears though, because I had to be silent for my dog to sleep.
But...he never did. He kept jerking awake every 15 minutes. After about an hour and a half of this, my dog jerked awake one final time. It gave me flashbacks to when my Akita did the same thing. After I tended to him and got him sleeping again, as soon as he laid down and closed his eyes, It was too much. I was remembering my Akita too much. I couldn’t take it anymore and started crying. Apparently it was LOUD. I didn’t even realize, but according to my mother, she heard it from the second floor when she came to check on me. I thought nobody would be able to hear me even outside my door, but apparently I was crying extremely uncontrollably. I didn’t tell my mom why I cried, though.

I have the number of the lady who had my dog, and I called her every now and then to ask how my Akita was...she never answered. It always times out. My mother is refusing to give me any details and just says she has her and she’s fine. What the hell do I do? I love my new dog yes, but I’m such a wreck right now...I can’t even interact with my new dog for a long time because I just remember my Akita, get depressed  and feel like crying. Thankfully, others are happy to take him off my hands temporarily whenever I need a break...though, they’re the one asking me to take him for a bit.

I just don’t know. What do I do?


[UPDATE]


A lot has happened in these two hours, actually.

Yesterday I asked my mom why the person who bought my dog wasn’t responding, she hesistated for 3 seconds and said she re-sold sold the dog and she forgot to told me. I didn’t believe her.
The reason I was calling the person who bought my dog was because she said I could visit her and ask her for updates. I also had a mini interview with her about how she’d treat the dog, and she came out fine. Though, I just called her for the second time today, and she finally responded. She did confirm that she sold my dog. When I asked her if that meant I couldn’t visit, she said “Obviously. I don’t know where she is”.  I continued that conversation a bit talking about how I should have made it clear in our agreement that I would get to visit her, and that it was my bad that I didn’t specify.


Later, my mom called me. She asked me why I called TPWBMD. I told her I just wanted to know what was up for sure. She explained to me that she told me everything yesterday and that TPWBMD said I was bothering her by calling constantly. She also said that this made her look like a bad mother because now TPWBMD thinks my mom didn’t tell me about what she did to my dog, which she didn’t until I explicitly asked her.

After that, I kinda hatched a plan. I called our vet and pretended that I somehow lost the microchip digits of my dog, and if they could tell me the code so I could write it down in her dog passport. They asked me if I had the dog, I lied and said yes. They said I can just bring her in and they’d scan and give me the code. I pretended that I was too lazy to, and said if it was possible if I provided details.

After confirming my name, phone number, my dogs name, breed, etc, they knew I was the guy with her at the vet for sure. After 30 minutes, I was told the tracking chip code.

I went all over the internet looking for the contact info of the new owner of my dog. It seems it doesn’t exist. I think I have to wait until the guy who newly owns her puts his info on the tracking chip, then I can input that into some website and I’ll get his contact info and maybe he will agree to update me on my Akita regularly. Or hell...maybe visit? I wish with all my heart this goes well."

My daughter is a brilliant girl, she's just graduated high school and is about to enter college at SIXTEEN. When I was her age I was an absolute idiot (Shit I mean I HAD her when I was sixteen). However when it comes to seeing red flags/character flaws, my daughter is kind of stupid. My daughter is an adult in my eyes, she has a scholarship full ride, a job and is pretty self sufficient, so there is NO guerrilla style parenting to be done, I just need to convince her with logic that her new boyfriend is a total piece of shit. Essentially she started dating this 18 year old guy we'll just call Devon 2 months ago. Devon rubbed me the wrong way instantly, he's a college football player of like 6'4 with blonde hair (Just imagine a stereotypical rich douche bag who plays football in school). When we first met he was trying to charm me the best he could with a disgustingly superficial mask. When I first went to dinner with his family and my daughter there were multiple red flags I spotted instantly when paying attention to their relationship dynamic. When Devon's parents asked her questions Devon would motion her to stop talking and then talk over her, he'd constantly tell my daughter what to do and when, he seemed super controlling. I did a background check on him and what do you know, he had a DUI from like 8 months ago when he had first turned 18.

I had also noticed little things as well, such as one time I watched him drop my daughter off and he didn't know I was watching, and he was speeding at like 40 in a residential before dropping her off and peeling out like a douche. I really just don't like this kid and he seems EXACTLY like my ex wife who was a fucking psychotic bitch who made my life hell every day. Thing is, I can't really do dick about it. I'm not a prude, I make super explicit disturbing music for a living and have had a criminal past before so I ABSOLUTELY do not believe in trying to control or forcefully direct an almost adult into doing what I think is right for them. If I tell her she can't be with him, she'll just blow me off and move in with him, what am I going to restrain my daughter from leaving the house??

I'm really scared for my daughter and if this fucking piece of shit gets her pregnant I will be immensely sad at the pain everyone will face in the future. And SURE, maybe he's not such a bad dude after all and his flaws will mature with him and they'll go through ups and downs for the next decade or so, that's all great but I REALLY do not want that ghetto unstable life for my daughter, I would know I've been through it.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Well... I decided to browse this kids social media pages after getting suggested him as a friend on Facebook and Instagram... He's even more of a douche then I had first thought.

I didn’t really find her very attractive, however I sat with her and we talked for a while about our lives and what we liked to do and then she had to go to class. I told her to have a good one and we went out opposite doors. I feel like a total dick because I feel like I’m being shallow and everything, but I’m not attracted to her. What should I do?

I came back from school just this weekend, and was using my computer, when I found the “discord” chat app. Originally, I didn’t think much of it, and assumed it was for her to talk to her friends when she plays.

I looked through her chats, and found a person she has been talking to since May 15th, called “chatline.” As I scrolled up I found out that she was sending nude pictures, and videos, to this guy who seems to be around the age of 17 (I found his Instagram).

He says thing like “I’m going to cut myself if you don’t reply to me,” and sends gifs of sexual positions he wants to try with my sister. I could hardly even look at what I was reading.

It appears as though they are dating online. I am completely shocked and can’t believe that this is happening. My sister has been manipulated and exposed to things she just shouldn’t be around at 12 years old.

I’m really stuck and don’t know what to do. On the one hand I could tell my parents, but I don’t want to ruin the relationship between my sister and them, or I could talk to her directly. I want to report this guy she’s talking to as a child predator, but I don’t know what is best to do."

Little backstory: my parents always have an early thanksgiving gathering the weekend before, because my brother and 2 sisters work thanksgiving day. On Saturday we had our gathering at my parents house. I’m 22 (M) and I still live at home. My brother and sister in law just had a baby, and I haven’t ever really cared for her. My brother makes a stupid amount of money with his job, thus his wife makes it known that they are wealthy and walks with her nose in the air and acts like she is above me and my other siblings. She has always been mean to me, and even told my brother that if we wanted to hang out, it would have to be at my parents house because I would dirty their house, because I am 5 years old, after all. Anyway, the night of our gathering she had asked my mom where she could breast feed, and my mom told her to do it in my brothers old room, the room next to mine. She excused herself a few times and fed my nephew. During family gatherings, I always close my bedroom door, usually because it’s really dirty and I don’t want it to be an eye sore when people walk by it to use the bathroom. 

My sister had gotten me a poster from her work for my birthday, and I went to go put it in my room, and when I opened the door my sister in law was sitting on MY chair in MY room, breast feeding my nephew. She literally screamed as if I had brought 3 of my friends to watch her. A, it was an accident and I had no intention of trying to watch her take out her boobs. B, she was in my room, I don’t think I have to knock before I enter MY room. My brother came to her rescue and she started screaming that I was a pervert and that I was probably waiting for the right moment to walk in on her. My brother asked me what my problem was and I said that I had no idea she was in there and that she was supposed to be in his room. She then said that my recliner was more comfortable for her to sit in. She then kept calling me a pervert and disgusting, so after arguing with them and pleading my case she and my brother left. Now I feel like she’s gonna be telling people that I did it on purpose, and she will probably spin it and say that I tried to take pictures or something. I have a girlfriend that I see naked so I wouldn’t want anything to do with her anyway. Not sure what I should do. I still have to see her for the remainder of the holidays, and even though I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s really bothering me. 

TLDR: my sister in law was breastfeeding in my bedroom without my knowledge, so I accidentally walked in on her with her boobs out, and she proceeded to scream at me and call me a pervert


Update: I wanna say thanks for the advice. There’s been a lot of comments and I can’t read and reply to each one individually. I know there’s a better way to post updates but I don’t have the time or energy to do that. So here’s an update since last night. My mom told me she talked to my sister in law, and told her she didn’t appreciate that outburst in our house. That I had every right to go into my bedroom and that she should have asked before going in there. According to my mom, she responded semi-well to that and she said she may have overreacted. That may have been my mom trying to get me to be less anxious about it, but I will try to take her word for it. My brother and I are meeting up this weekend and I’m gonna help him move stuff out of his basement so that’ll be the perfect time to hash things out. She will be gone, so she can’t interfere. A lot of comments dragged my brother, and yes, he was the asshole who could have defused things by defending me and telling her to calm down. I told him I would only help him and talk to him if he promises not to be an ass and let me tell my side. Also a lot of people said this was fake?? I know throwaway accounts are usually trolling but i swear this is not fake!! I wouldn’t want anyone to be put in this awkward and anxious situation, especially with family and I don’t know who would lie about something like this??Another thing, people want to know what my girlfriend thought, she was upset and angry just like me. She said that it wasn’t fair how she treated me and that it makes her disappointed in my brothers lack of understanding. So that’s how things are now. Hopefully my brother listens to what I have to say. He knows me better than anyone and he knows I would never do anything to deliberately make his family uncomfortable."

A few nights ago I was working late at a restaurant where I live. I had to close the store and I didn’t get home until 11:00PM. Myself and my boyfriend started watching TV when I got home and I started to get ready for bed. I just finished brushing my teeth when my phone read 12:14AM and I was receiving a call from my father who lives 3 hours away from me. I initially knew it was strange for him to be calling me that hour. 

When I picked up the phone my father was severely crying. I’ve never heard him cry before so I found this very strange. I felt my heart sink to my feet. I could tell he was very intoxicated as well. He was telling me that his wife of 12 years (my step-mother) had left the house earlier that day due to an argument they had. Then he started talking about how she has been cheating on him for awhile. I had no idea this was happening and I was very shocked. He began to bring up his will to me and said if anything happens to him to please not forget him. He said Father’s Day is soon coming and he didn’t want me to forget him. 

He then started to cry more severely. He was crying so hard that I could barely understand what he was saying. I told him to repeat what he said which was “I’m in the garage with the rifle. I’m going to blow my brains out now. I wanted to call and hear your voice for one last time.” My boyfriend jumped out of bed and went into the other room and started speaking to the police where my father lives. 

While I was waiting for the police to arrive I had to stall my father from shooting himself. I brought up anything I could think of. My faucet in my kitchen is leaky so I asked if he could come fix it. I ended up having to stall him for 1 hour and 20 minutes before the police showed up. He did live. I stalled him long enough for the police to take him to the hospital. The police seized the firearm and told me when they went into the garage he had a bed made out of towels and clothes. They said this must have been planned. They also said the rifle was fully loaded. My father had also drank a 26oz of whiskey, half a flask of whiskey, and a tallboy of beer.

He has been admitted for 72 hours as that is protocol. He got released yesterday and I’ve never felt so worried in my entire life. My step-mother has not showed any concern as she only picked him up from the hospital to bring him home. She did not stay at the house with him last night and it was his first night home. 

Everyone has been telling me that I saved his life. I honestly feel like I haven’t done anything. I can’t see any good In this situation. I’m terrified.  I cannot travel to where he lives because I have a job where I am. I would not be able to pay my rent. I offered to go get him and bring him to my city. He has friends where I live and I believe it would be good for him. He refused and said he doesn’t want to go anywhere because he needs to fix his car. He also said he needs to figure out what he is going to do with his house. I want to be with him but I can’t. I’m so scared. I don’t know how I will ever stop worrying about this."

Over the years my partner has gained considerable weight. I do everything I can to support her but at the same time I have noticed that I am becoming less physically attracted to her. I've just supported her whenever she mentioned wanting to eat more healthily and parked my feelings beyond that. Recently however, she has been noticing herself that I'm less attracted to her and started asking about it. I don't know how to approach that conversation, as I am afraid that the way I explain my feelings can have a very bad impact on her, as this is understandably a highly sensitive subject. Any advice is welcome.

EDIT2: Here's how I ended up addressing the problem; first, I gained some perspective through all your help. It made me realize that I was still very much attracted to her, but that I was feeling helpless; we want to get another child but she recently told me her weight might be hindering her fertility, which was not something I had on my radar and it made me panic and focus too much on her weight. I went to Reddit because she saw I was in a bad place and I was being distant because I didn't know what to do with it. In the end I bought her some flowers and apologized for being cold the previous night.  We talked about what I was going through and what she's been going through. It was brief and lighthearted and we both felt empowered afterwards."

My car payment is overdue and my car insurance company says if I miss another one they will cancel my policy and I will be without car OR renter's insurance. Since I have missed credit card payments and my car insurance payment, my credit score is up, and my premium will surely fly up next time me policy updates. I have a car lease payment coming up in 6 days and if the government is open by then I still won't have another paycheck ready to pay. I might lose my car if it happens twice. My landlord is very understanding but I made an agreement to pay this months rent next month when I get my paycheck. I have around $215 in my savings and I'm currently using that as gas, food, and utility money. When the government is back up I will have to pay off my missed credit card payments and late fees with the next paycheck, my car and renters insurance and lease, rent plus utilities, and overdraft fees for when my car insurance tried to take $176 out of my checking account when I had less than $100 in it.

Well I reported him.

After I reported him, more kids reported him. The stories just got worst. He smacked a girls butt, he banged Potts and pans in kids ears who had ptsd to get them to start shaking and so on. 

After I reported him a lot of friends of mine started hating on me. Telling me that I was stupid to report him, that nothing was going to be done about it. It became stressful just to be there. 

I started having a panic attack everyday in that class, the class became a huge trigger I was fine the rest of the day. Just that one class. After numerous talks with the AP and guidance councilors I was allowed to sit in the hallway, go to another class, or sit in the office, if I started having a panic attack. After a week of that. They finally changed my schedule. Now I am no longer even in culinary.

My brother is 8 years old, and he's been exhibiting some behaviors for 2+ years. He changes his voice depending on who he's talking to, either higher or lower. He is extremely violent. He will lie for no reason, sometimes doing things like going to our parents out of the blue and claiming I beat him up. He can cry on command. It's the scariest thing I've ever seen. He'll be angry and cursing me out and yelling (but not crying) and then when a parent walks in the room from the noise immediately switch to crying. It looks SO real, sobbing and moaning with tears pouring out. He is grooming my Mom in a way I didn't even think was possible. He is her favorite by a lot, and he is always hugging her, cuddling her, writing her ""I love you notes"", kissing her, and even saying things like ""she is the only person I love"" ""She is the most beautiful woman ever"" or ""I want to be with her forever"". However, that is all in front of her. Behind her back, he doesn't seem to like her all that much. She has completely fallen for it. Once, he poked himself with a pencil. He ran to our Mom and claimed a stabbed him with it. My other two siblings had been in the room and both said I didn't do it. I still got punished. He is always throwing us under the bus to cover his tracks and we are ALWAYS blamed for it, in the face of all the evidence. One time, he went into my room and purposely broke a necklace my Grandma gave me. He ripped it in half. I got kicked out of the house for 3 hours because he told his mom I was ""bullying him"". ANYTHING he tells her, she believes and punishes us really bad. Once, I called him a ""whiner"" because he was complaining his water was too cold. I didn't yell or anything just said ""don't be a whiner"". He called me a ""Fuck"". I got in trouble for bullying him, and he got off scot free.I believe my Mom is enabling him, and that is making things worse, but I don't know what to do anymore. I'm scared that one day the lie will be so big, and my mom will be so under his thumb, that I'll get hurt. I'm lost and scared. What should I do?

Edit:

Thank you to the person who gave me the silver and platinum badges! They look really cool

So, today I learned that he is too young to be a psychopath! I don't really know what to put in the title, but feel free to replace it with what you think is best in the comments

Wow, I'm never gotten this many comments!!! I'll try to reply to as many as I can, but I'm sorry if I miss yours

So, I'm trying to upvote and put helped on as many things as I can. To answer some of what seems to be the main questions

1. The brother is the second youngest
2. The ages range from 3-14
3. I am a 14 year old girl
4. There has been some hitting/kicking against me, but I don't think any of it was as awful as the parents who get their kids taken
5. My family does not believe in therapy, and the time I mentioned it they freaked out a little
6. There seems to be a lot of different advice, but thank you to anyone and everyone who has commented. It really means the world that you gave me your two cents!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll post an update with what I decide to do, but I'm not very sure yet. Some of the comments closest to the top have very different idea (all with good points)!

UPDATE:

So, I talked to my mom. I wrote out a nicer version of this comment and just talked to her about it. I tried to not mention the awful things, and brought up some of the smaller issues. I brought both of my siblings, and got my grandma involved. My mom was really upset at first, but we all came at it from a really good place (hugging, smiling, saying we loved her, and we just wanted a better relationship) and she got really sad. I think she knew she that deep down, favoring him was wrong. She cried, and we all talked it out and I felt closer to my mom than I have in ages.  I took a lot of this advice for what to do before and after the conversation. She said she really wants to change, and promised to try. I noticed she did a couple small things later in the day that she never would have done before (getting mad at my brother, giving all of us a treat she bought). It's obviously very recent, but I think cracking down on these behaviors will help my brother in the long run. I'll see if this is a false promise or not, but we all had a really nice group hug. Thank you Reddit, because I don't think I would have made this decision otherwise. I think that this might be turn into something really wonderful. Thank you everyone, for everything."

Last post is in my profile. Long story short, my [now ex] girlfriend went totally ghost about a week ago. I haven't heard a word from her.

Finally got word back from her best friend. He says basically, she just does this every now and then. He says she has done it to him multiple times in their friendship and that it could take up to a month for her to come back. She just does this. She just disappears.

I told him to please tell her when she comes back that I can't be in a relationship with someone who will literally fall off the face of the planet whenever she feels like it without so much as a warning or a quick text saying shes okay. I completely understand taking time for yourself and going dark for a while. But if you are going to be gone long it seems like common courtesy to contact loved ones and let them know you are OK.

I dated the bassist for a band for over a year and we had periods of silence because he was off with the band but he always let me know ahead of time so I didn't worry.

I'm very frustrated but kinda relieved. I feel more confident in my decision to move forward now. Thank you to everyone who gave their advice on my last post. Best wishes to all.

UPDATE: Seeing as this post is getting a lot of attention still (thank you by the way, I have never surpasssed 500 karma on one post) I figured I would update all newcomers on the situation.

She contacted me last night saying she had just gotten released after being Baker Acted. Thursday night, she attempted suicide and was sent to the hospital for two nights. I do not know how, or even why, she attempted to kill herself, I may never know.

Regardless of how I felt about the soonness of the break up, I knew I had to do it. She took it well and agreed. We accepted the mere fact that she needs to work on herself before getting into a relationship.

Ultimately things are okay now and the dust has settled on that front. Another storm is brewing as I deal with more personal things that are causing stress but at least for now, this is settled."

He is part of my regular dnd group and is always the most involved. He is bright and generally pretty chill. He has a girlfriend and enjoys movies. He is gainfully self employed.

I didnt know his past that well and didnt really know anything until a mutual friend found a website with a photo of him and the following information. I have re-named him Will for anonymity.

&gt; Will pleaded guilty to 20 charges of making and possessing almost 1,800 indecent images of children [over 4 years until 2013 when will was 21-25] including one extreme picture portraying intercourse or oral sex with a dead or live animal.

&gt;An officer posing as a parent [and Will] engaged in discussions about going to sexually abuse the 10 and six-year-old, ""children"" of the officer

&gt;Chat logs found on Will’s computer also showed he’d spoken to a 13-year-old girl about kissing and said it was a shame she didn’t live closer as they could’ve met.

&gt; At Court on Tuesday he admitted downloading the images and sharing them with other web users and, as some of them were of the highest level of indecency.

&gt;He was released on unconditional bail. 

I met him under two years later.

This information will destroy my small friendship circle. We are all close friends and I dont think everyone can move past this. Ome of us has recently moved abroad and that alone was a strain.

I am going to speak to him as I do not want to only hear the words from one unofficial website and cannot find court documents.

Do we stay friends? Do I tell our friends? 

I dont want to pose more questions as I just need advice. I am spinning and dont know what to do."

Now what i don't understand is that i brush my teeth properly day and night, shower day and night and yes i wear the same clothes because i am VERY picky and i have the same 3 pair of long pants and like 4 same shirts but every second day i change (underwear and socks every day) and my breath is not bad i use listerine and always chewing chewing gum and i don't understand what they are complaining about what should i do?

Edit: hey guys so i just finished speaking to my headmaster and he wrote that it wasn't them at all they found no problem so obviously it was some kid in my class there are only 2 people who hate me and 1 of them sits next to me and tomorrow ill speak to them and ill update the post.

Also thanks to everyone who wrote something i have looked at the comments and maybe i should look into buying new clothes thanks.

Update: so i went to school and confronted the two guys for the sake of the story the names will be james and john, and i will be speaking sought of how it was.

So i went to school and saw james and john i went up and asked them who wrote this letter ""james started laughing and said he did (pointing to john) john didn't deny it at all. I asked how come he wrote the letter, why was it necessary? (Just keep in my mind he is they type of dick head who thinks he is really cool but very dumb and always has to use the word ni**er in every sentence also when he can't respond he responds saying yo mama) anyways this is what he said, I'm sick of you wearing the same clothes every dam day and how you always feel like the top just couse you smart"". And then i ask ""but why in letter form why about my breath?"" He said, ""if you saw in letter form it looks official maybe you will change"". I responded in saying ""well I'm rather comfortable how i am dressed and don't really plan on changing"". He said, ""well ye that's couse u a stupid fucking ni**er"" (just to clarify we are both white) and i said , ""ahh so i guess you don't have a response"", ""nah dumbass i do i just don't want to respond to your stupid white ass"" and i just ended in saying"" i don't have time for people like you i got better things in life to do"" as i was about to walk away he pushed me very hard and the headmaster was standing there watching the whole thing and he took john in to his office. 

Look if this ever happens to you just confront the guy and if you see he is a dumbass just leave it its not worth it."

Thank you to everyone who said such kind and encouraging words to me. Its been nearly 24 hours and I feel so much better. I scrolled through every single comment and tried to up vote the majority. 

Most comments made me cry because of how kind you were and how you helped me to remember every good moment. 

Of course there was the occasional rude/troll comment, and even those made me cry, but that's okay.

In summary, thank you to every single person who helped me get through the day. It really boosted my mood.

Two weeks on and the raw, breathtaking and soul deep pain is still as raw and overwhelming as it was that first day.... Reddit, how do I get through this? I'm drowning in my pain and struggling to see a way out."

Hi Reddit. 
I’m desperate for some advice, love, whatever, I don’t know. 
I am a 25 year old woman, who was inseparable with my mum. We were best friends. I have a 1 year old daughter and my mum was like another mum to her. 
She was everything to me. My dad passed away when I was just a baby so she raised me and my 2 siblings on her own.
And she did the most amazing job. She loved us all so much and got us through the hardest time of her life. 
She was the kindest, most caring and beautiful soul. She was a social worker so that shows in itself that she wanted to help others. 
She also did a lot of volunteer work for different organisations in our community and communities overseas. 
She was a woman of faith, and always put everyone else before herself. Loved God, life, family, everyone. 
Another example of this is that she had 800 people at her funeral.
Double of what we had expected. 
Less than 2 weeks ago she was killed in a horrible car accident. Her and I were on the phone together at the time (handsfree, Bluetooth, totally safe and legal) talking on our morning trip to work like we did every morning at the same time, when a car (definitely in the wrong as confirmed by police) came speeding from the opposite direction head on into my mum. Our conversation was cut so short, I heard everything, the crash, the struggle, the people trying to save her, but she died on the scene. I raced to the scene after a witness picked up the phone and told me where the accident occurred. I didn’t think she was gone, I had hoped I would make it to see her but I never got that chance. 
I am really struggling with this, now that the funeral is over and there’s a lot of downtime. 
My partner and I were having difficulties before this happened and I moved in with my mum a month ago, and now I feel so lost. 
I feel so alone. Has anyone been through such loss and felt they wouldn’t get through it, yet they did?
I’d love to hear from you, or anyone, at all with anything to potentially help. 
Thanks a lot. 
Might I add I am also struggling with the fact that the other driver only ended up with a possible foot surgery. Not that it really changes anything regardless, but I can’t help but feel a lot of hurt and anger at the whole situation. 

TL;DR - struggling with loss of mum in tragic car accident, heard the whole thing on the phone (legally) already lost father, struggling to cope with a one year old and lack of partner (as we were already having difficulties). I need help.

EDIT- thank you all so much for your support, advice, condolences, suggestions and love. I will try to respond to you all in intervals so please don’t think I’ve ignored your comment. I’m reading them all and responding when I can. I am so overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from you all.. and am so glad I reached out xx"

How should I do it? What should I say? Update: First of all, thank you so much to everyone for the advice and encouragement. It made me so much more confident in my idea and bringing it to life. On to the story: We had a tour today and happened to stop in a valley in Glencoe. I couldn’t think of a more beautiful, memorable place and decided to roll with it. He was incredibly surprised and absolutely loved the ring. I essentially told him how happy I was with him, and how proud I was of us making it to where we were. Then I asked him if we could take the time to travel together, despite any other situation, every couple of years. He agreed, and I asked again and again, “Do you promise?”. When he finally said yes I presented the ring and he was awestruck. I opted out of having it videoed because every time I thought about it I wanted to vomit due to anxiety. But, here is a [picture of cocky husband with said ring](https://imgur.com/gallery/l9vj3n8) .

I’m actually already married, but it is now two years later.  So why do I want to propose? Two weeks before our wedding day my husband was fired, meanwhile I was unemployed, and we had just signed a lease for a relatively expensive apartment. This left us with zero income and dwindling savings. We couldn’t afford to get him a ring and while he rarely mentions it, I know it upset him. I saved up some of my income and purchased an absolutely gorgeous, customized and engraved ring, that I am eager to present to him.

As of today, we are on the last leg of our long awaited, two week honeymoon abroad. Our final destination is Edinburgh, and I plan to “propose” while on a scenic hike. I need help with what to say or do however, as I’m not really into the kneeling bit and I doubt he would be either. He (M31) is quite sensitive and romantic, while I am less romantic but trying (F23). And suggestions?? I welcome any ideas as well as things that would make you personally swoon. And go!"

Please help. I need advice breaking free from them as an adult. I know that I am likely going to be poked fun at, but I am lost and need advice. Thank you if you read through this.

&amp;#x200B;

... I am quite embarrassed of my situation, but I have no one to talk to that I think would understand my circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is EXTREMELY over protective, and this caused me to become the epitome of sheltered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes; I know that I sound ungrateful, but let me explain:

&amp;#x200B;

I was a victim to a very serious stalker case when I was 12 to the age of 14, and this stalker, and my fear of them, consumed my life.

I became TERRIFIED of people, terrified to leave my house, and I started doing ""home-schooling"" in the seventh grade, but my mother never pushed me to do my studies. If I was sad, I was coddled, but I was never taken to a therapist for some reason... and I took advantage of this as I was too young to see the detriment of me not taking my education seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I did not have anything higher than a seventh grade education. My mom sheltered me even more, which makes sense in a way, as I had a man who was threatening my safety on a daily basis... but he is in prison now, and for the longest time (until I was 18), I had the social skills of someone who seemingly grew up on a deserted island their entire life. I'd shake like a chihuahua when people would merely look at me, and I'd be made fun of it by strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

I barely have left the house from the age of 12 to the age of 20, and it is just... fucking embarrassing and depressing. I am an ambitious person, and I want so much more for myself, but it feels as though my mom is sabotaging me because she wants to keep me at home.

&amp;#x200B;

It was acceptable for me to obtain a GED from the age of 17-18 where I live, but I had to FIGHT with my mother to get her to drive me to take the test for it! There was always an excuse as to why I shouldn't get my GED.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have a license, as you could guess. So, I am completely reliant on my mother to get me places. I'm not ""allowed"" to have a license, and before you say that is ridiculous, I am well aware. I live in the rural south, so nothing is in walking distance. Hell, we don't even have public transportation here. I don't have a job, nor money. 

&amp;#x200B;

After fighting with my mom, crying, begging every fucking day, **she finally drove me to get my GED when I was 19**. Despite only having a seventh grade education, I obtained my GED easily within a few days because I self-educated myself (though, not in the traditional sense.)

&amp;#x200B;

My mother instills fear in me in everything I do. I am borderline paranoid because of the exaggerated tinfoil hat-esque theories of, ""SOMEONE IS GOING TO COME UP TO YOU IN WAL-MART AND TRY TO DRUG YOU, AND PUT YOU INTO SEX TRAFFICKING,"" Again, I am **20 years old**. She wants to hold hands when we walk across streets, and ... before you say, ""it means she loves you! You should be grateful."" I do know that, and I am thankful that she cares about me, but this type of behavior does more harm than good in me, I think. I love her. She loves me. I know. I am not ungrateful for that.

&amp;#x200B;

... I'm upset and seeking advice, because I'm fighting tooth and nail to try and get to college, but she demands that I go to the local college here (and even then, I'm not ""allowed"" to go for MONTHS, so I get to stay at home doing absolutely nothing for even longer), and maybe I am resembling a childlike baby throwing a tantrum because they can't get the toy they want, but I don't wanna fucking be in this town, living with my mom anymore. I want to get out, I feel as though I need to get out. I wanna move out of state, but how the fuck am I gonna afford a plane ticket? How am I going to even get to the airport? How am I gonna go about filling about my FAFSA if she won't take me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it really more practical for me to stay here? I am not ""allowed"" to get a job (lol,) and even though this is utter bullshit, I have no way of transporting myself to and back from work because I am dirt-poor.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just allow her to control me, and stay at home? It upsets me that I even have to consider that. I'm an adult.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever other family members are over, they always scoff at her, and make remarks about how ridiculous she is being, but even then, when I speak to them about how I wanna move out of state, they tell me I ""can't"" because I'm too sheltered, and I wouldn't be able to handle it. I just wanna scream... 

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do...?

&amp;#x200B;

How do I exercise detachment in this scenario? Where do I even go from here?"

I don’t want to get sick and I don’t want to get someone else sick. I’m scared to talk to the school nurse because she doesn’t really like me and might tell my mom and I would get in SO MUCH TROUBLE.  My mom might take me out of school if she found out but I don’t know.

I was having multiple dreams where I had to take a break from what I was doing to use the restroom. This resulted in the longest and highest velocity pee’s, probably, known to man. 
After the third one, I woke up to a feeling of moisture in my net here region. Panic ensued. 
My wife is asleep. 
I get out of bed. I examine the wet spot with my phone light. It’s about 5”-7” in diameter. I got to the bathroom to utilize the facilities, and wash and dry my nether regions. I grab a small towel. I go back to my bed. OH NO! My wife has rolled towards my side of the bed in my absence. I give her a nudge and she rolls back to her side. I place the small towel on the small(?) spot. I lay on this towel with my butt, applying pressure and trying to absorb what I can. 

1. Do I tell my wife? If so, what do I tell her?

2. How do I come up with an excuse to wash our sheets again since our last wash 3 days ago? She works from home due to COVID-19, and it being a 1 BR apartment, she’ll notice my putting it into the washer. Also, she wakes up after me, and I still go to work for 7 hours out of the day. 

3. What if it stains the mattress underneath? Am I resigned to changing the sheets myself for the next 7 years. Our mattress is a year old. I don’t know the average lifetime of a mattress. 

4. I’m so tired, I haven’t been sleeping well the last couple weeks, and tonight was the first night we went to bed on the earlier side. I’m afraid if I go back to sleep, I’ll allow my wife to overtake the bed. Promoting her to ask about the towel, maybe? How do I make up the 4 hours of sleep I’m going to lose?

Yeah. You read it right. Today, at 24 years old, I tried to commit suicide for the first time. I guess if you're here you probably want the backstory, huh? I feel so stupid over it, but maybe writing will help. Maybe someone will respond and make me feel less alone. Maybe...Idk. Just maybe. Anyway. Into the story I guess.



Six years ago I met this girl. She was weird af. Theatre kid, into odd shit. Total weirdo.



This total weirdo would wind up becoming my best friend, and for the purpose of this story, we'll call her Angie.



Angie and I haven't always been on great terms. When we first became friends we were really close. Then, she got super close with another girl, who we'll call...Trina. The closer Angie and Trina got, the further away I was driven. After a while I quit talking to her because I didn't feel important. This would happen two more times. The first time we went four months without speaking, and she reached out and we became friends again. The second time I think it was about six months and I reached out. The third time was nine months, and she reached out. The last time she reached out was about one year ago exactly. In between all those ""break ups"" we got really close. Her and Trina quit talking completely. The biggest problem became the boys she would date. They would treat her like shit, I would get angry, eventually couldn't stand to watch it anymore, and then I would leave. Every time hoping she would ask me to stay, and every time being left with silence.



Her and I connected so deeply that we were both convinced we were soulmates. Platonic, but soulmates nonetheless. Both of us believed that soulmates could be platonic, and both of us believe you have multiple.



It's important for you to know that we both, from the very beginning, have always been straight. I've never been in a relationship, and she's been with two men, and now that I've said this I'm sure you can guess what's coming next.



About seven months ago I started wondering if I was entirely straight. I don't know what made me think about it, but something did. Then shit hit the fan.



About two weeks ago I realized that I had feelings for Angie. I'll never forget it. I was picking up laundry to wash when I realized it. I've always had this idea that I need to find Angie in a man for me to be happy. That if I find the male version of my best friend I'll be set. Then one day the thought occurred to me that maybe I shouldn't be trying to find a male version of her because of the whole ""you can't duplicate people"" thing. Maybe I was just interested in her from the beginning...From there it spiraled.



I began to worry a lot. What did it mean? Why did I have these feelings? How long had I had them? Am I feeling this because I'm lonely or because it's legit? What if this destroyed my friendship? How could I tell her? Could I tell her? What if I told her? It was a lot. I was especially worried that I wasn't actually feeling anything and that I was just lonely. Then we went to the beach for my birthday and that's when the fire nation attacked (I'm depressed. Just roll with the crappy Avatar references)



During the day she would mention that she needed to find a guy like this, or she wanted a man like that, or guy this, guy that. Blah blah blah. And every time she would mention it I would get insanely jealous. At this point I guess it's worth mentioning that I have depression. Diagnosed, untreated. Don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. I assure you, I do. Anyway, it was at this point that I realized the feelings were real. I panicked.



I made it through the day and promptly went home that night and absolutely lost it. I self-harmed a lot when I was a teen. Abusive home since I was young, no other way to cope...yeah. Anyway, I went about five years without doing it. Then I relapsed back in November of 2018. Then again in March of 2019. Then again last Saturday. When I got home from the beach and promptly lost my shit.



Angie knew something was up the second I got home. We talk 24/7, so she knows how I speak and type. If anything is even remotely off, she'll catch it. And she did. She prodded and prodded until she eventually guessed what was going on and I admitted that, yes, I did have feelings. She told me she didn't know if she could be a couple because she didn't know how she felt about sex with a woman. She then told me that she did, however, have feelings for me.



I was happy. She told me that it wouldn't ruin our friendship, she was glad I told her, and that she would wait for me to figure out what I wanted.



The next day we talked again and I told her I knew what I wanted and that I was just waiting to see where she would land. She told me she was down to try. I was happy again.



Then the next night we hung out at a park and we talked about it. For two hours. She told me she was 80% yes. That she wanted to try, that she could see where it would work, and even confessed to one point in the past a few years ago when she wanted to kiss me. She told me she just needed time to get used to the idea. After a week of anxiety, I felt like I could finally breathe. She wanted me too. She was 80% yes. It was good.



Then today. I've been waiting to get a definite yes or no from her. Today I got my answer.



She told me no.



After all of it. The 80% yes. The wanting to kiss me in the past. Telling me she thought it would work. Talking about how certain people would react to us being a couple. Telling me she wanted to try. After all of this, she said her answer was no. That she only sees me as a friend, and that she's still healing from her ex of over a year.



Needless to say, I shattered. Every time I've ever wanted someone, they never want me back. The last time I really, truly had feelings for someone was six years ago. I wanted this so god damn badly. Wanted it so much I couldn't breathe. I was anxious all day, everyday, for six days. I ate next to nothing because of the anxiety.



I left work 40 minutes early. I got in the car, and broke. For months I've been struggling with my mental health. Depression is a fucking bitch. Because of that depression, I had a suicide plan. Every suicidal person does. Even if they're too scared to enact it, we all know how we'd do it. Mine was simple. Drive to this secluded area an hour away from home. It's in the middle of no where, so no one would bother me. Drive there, plug the exhaust pipes on my car, get back in, take sleeping pills, go to sleep, and voila. Dead.



I made it to step five.



I left work and immediately got on the highway and headed to my suicide spot. There was no hesitation, which was a first. I just got in the car and went. Without thinking. Well...maybe I thought a little, because I stopped at walgreens to buy melatonin, water, and duct tape (to cover the window cracks). I bought a journal too.



At first I was hyperventilating. Not because of the suicide, but because of the rejection. I couldn't breathe. Then the more I drove the calmer I got. It would be over soon. Just a few more hours and then I wouldn't feel any of this anymore. It was so muthafucking comforting.



I eventually made it there, and did exactly what I set out to do. I was shaking, but I wanted to do it, so I did. I opened my trunk, grabbed a cardigan and a towel from the beach that was still sitting there (bigger problems, don't judge me), and I plugged both of my exhaust pipes. I got back in the car, and downed a handful of Melatonin. Idk how many I took. Maybe 50? 60? I knew I wouldn't OD on it. I just wanted to fall asleep before the carbon monoxide affected me in case it gave me a headache or something. Anyway, I downed the Melatonin, reclined my seat back, and laid down. I texted Angie. Told her where I was. Told her I was sorry. That I loved her. Ten minutes later she blew up my phone. Anyway, back to how I'm still breathing. I was dozing off when my phone buzzed (from Angie). I went to grab my phone to check it and I couldn't move my hand. Moving my arm was so hard. I panicked. My survival instinct kicked in. Had she not texted me I've no doubt I would be dead right now. Frankly, I wish I'd just turned my phone off. That's what I get for wanting to know what her last words to me would be. I regret not turning the phone off.



I panicked when I realized I couldn't move my hand, and by some force of adrenaline I opened my door and stuck my head out and breathed. I could smell the grass. It smelled nice.



I eventually wound up sitting on the ground. I don't remember how I got there. Leaning against my car with my door open. I lost it. I sobbed. And sobbed, and sobbed, and sobbed. I've never had so much mascara all over my face before. Was a bitch to wipe off when the random car came down the road to check on the weirdo loser in the Nissan just sitting in a field by herself. Being unwanted by the person you want the most is soul crushing. Make fun of me all you want. Call me a weak piece of shit. I lost a piece of myself today, and I don't know if I'll ever get it back.



That's essentially it. I sat there for three hours. Just sat there. Sobbing. Texting. Wondering why I'm not enough. Being angry that I didn't just stay in the fucking car. As I'm writing this I'm sitting in a motel room. Couldn't find my laptop charger, so I'm working on what little battery I had when I left the house. I don't know where I go from here. My head hurts from crying. My stomach is a disaster from all the Melatonin. Mostly my fucking heart hurts. So god damn bad. I've never been this crushed by a rejection. I don't know how I get over this. Idk where I go from here. I don't know anything except that this destroyed me.



If you read all of this, thank you. Thank you for listening. Idk that I feel any better, but I like having this exist in the world somewhere. Idk why. I just do. Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. I feel like I’m just screaming internally and I’m so tired of my own voice.



The journal I bought only has one thing written in it. I wrote it before I took the Melatonin. I was hoping they would be my last words, and I'm sad to say I still believe it.



""Maybe some people are just born to die.""

Edit: When I wrote this last night I didn’t anticipate this response. I’m currently sitting in the same field I came to yesterday to die. This time it’s raining. There is no sun, the sky is gray, and it feels so god damn appropriate. I actually tried to imagine 400 people standing here in front of me. It’s a little overwhelming, ngl haha. Thank you all for this response. I’m still hurt. This is...Idk. It’s probably the worst I’ve ever felt. Like I said...I wanted it so badly. 

But I’m alive. And for the foreseeable future I will try to remain that way. I’ve read every comment. Thank you. Especially to those of you who shared your stories. Thank you to the girl who gave me the gratitude list idea. I may try that soon. I’m not gonna make this post too much longer than it already was, but just thank you. So god damn much 💜💜💜

Edit x2: Please stop commenting and telling me to get rid of Angie. She is my best friend first and foremost. Losing her isn’t an option for me. I wish she wanted me in that way. I wish so fucking badly that she did, but I’m not willing to lose her.

⭐️Edit x3: So this was just posted in a comment, but I figured I’d leave it here for any future readers. It’s been two months since this day, and things are very different now than they were when I posted this. The main difference being that I got help. I’m on medication and see a therapist regularly. Second, Angie and I are no longer on speaking terms. I needed space to deal with life and she wouldn’t give me that space. Third, I’m dating. My feelings for Angie are gone and I’ve actually found someone else and she’s pretty amazing. I’m okay. Things are okay. Thanks for reading my post 💜"

Took me and several of our friends by surprise, as they seemed so well. I know that they might have been hiding something as couples sometimes do but still, to use they seemed okay.

He is honestly one of the nicest people I know. Goes out of his way to help people, everyone loves him, never even cusses, just a all around nice dude. I’ve never even heard him shit talk someone, outside of complaining about work.

He seemed fine for about a month after they broke up. He didn’t really want to go into detail and we all respected that. The only time you could tell he was a little upset or depressed is when he would just stare off into space sometimes. We’ve been a support group for him through it all and if you asked me yesterday, I would have said he was okay.

Then, I ran into his ex today. I asked how she was and she kinda looked around and asked if I had heard from him lately. I said yeah since we talk all the time, but he didn’t seem different.

She told me he has been calling her at night. I thought it was kinda sad at first but then she told me more about it. He calls her from different numbers.

And when she answers, he just says her name over and over again, in a mocking way. 

Then he just laughs. Like an unhinged crazy person laugh. It’s clearly him, and I know that it’s his voice.

Just listening to one of the recordings she has, it made my blood kinda cold. Just the way he sounded, the way he yells her name like he knows something she doesn’t, before just laughing his ass off is scary as hell. Not even a good laugh, just a laugh you’d hear from someone who’s about to kill you.

I told her I’d try to talk to him and she thanked me. She was genuinely distressed. 

She said she never knows when it’s him, because he changes the number and the caller ID shows someone else on her phone. People from her contacts.

I’ve looked into doing that after she talked to me and it’s pretty fucking easy. Plenty of services online that do it.

How do I talk to him about this? I want to approach it delicately, as to not set him off."

I was one of the first of my friends to start drinking, and I've always been the heaviest drinker at parties and seshes, aswell as meals out, etc. All my friends (and myself) are 17-19 now, and so all drink. I'm still invited to parties and nights out, but I'm the only sober one now, while they all drink. I don't know how to be comfortable with it, or how to act. Does anyone have any advice or guidance on how to deal with being sober at an event where everyone else will be drinking?

edit: (just to clarify because a couple people got confused)my friends are not an all a problem in this, they support my recovery and are willing to help me 100%, and my social group is not the cause of my drink problem, it developed due to other issues, which i will not discuss here. my buddies are just european teens who like to have a good time at a party, but are not constant party go-ers and we do hang out sober most of the time, i just need some tips on what to do at events with drink, like eg birthday parties

I moved into this house about 8 months ago and haven’t really been too friendly with my neighbors due to work. 

My elderly neighbor approached me today asking for, “a big favor.” I asked him what that was and he said he needed to get to a certain city and that he needed a ride there to return some things. 

I told him that we are currently in that city that he wants to get to and asked what he needs to return and to whom. He invited me inside his home and showed me a pile of things, but said he doesn’t know who they belong to, but they need to be returned to  that city. I again let him know that we’re in that city and there’s really no other city in the US with that name. He tells me, “you see, that’s what has me confused, everyone keeps telling me that.” 

He has three very well behaved little dogs and he was talking to me about how he used to win dog shows and all that good stuff. Told me about his ex wife and how she took everything from him. He went on about how her friends found out where he lived and said he’s thinking of moving to Oklahoma where he had a lady friend. 

I go along and say something along the lines of, “oh must be nice, you kinda got it all figured it out then haha.” He again begins to tell me that he has a house in [specific city] and that it is identical to this one, down to the floor plan, but this isn’t his house. I tell him, “yeah tbh i think this might be your house. I’ve been living here for like 8 months and I see you all the time.” He again looks confused.

I had a great conversation with him and see that he had a very fulfilling life, but he’s just not all there anymore.

How do I go about getting him some help without stripping him of his dogs and his house?"

I know it's been a while so I guess I'll make an update post. Thank you everyone and sorry for taking so long, but it's been rough.

EDIT: the support is overwhelming. I wanna thank each and every one of you, reading through these has been wonderful. As you can imagine the past few hours have been a wild ride, so I have only been able to start reading 15 or so minutes ago. From now on I'll try my best to answer all the questions from the past hours and any new ones, although I don't think I have much time. My friend is now speaking with a CPS... person? and I'm just waiting outside. She hasnt said one single word until now and letting her hand go as she walked into the room was the most difficult thing I've done in years. Her hug was so warm and tight, I could feel all the pain she's going through and the thankfulness for being there for her. I'm really trying my best to be strong for her. I'll miss her family too. Her brother was a close friend of mine, her parents adored me and I really respected them. Her little sister was so adorable. I'll miss them so much. I don't know where I'm even finding the strength to talk about this. At first I wrote about them in present tense and had to go back. 

The post is a little vague and badly typed, sorry, I wrote it in a rush while I was still trying to understand what was going on and what to do. I don't feel like giving any personal information for now, sorry that I don't have a good reason or way to explain why but it just feels like I shouldnt. Though I think I should clarify that it was an accident, caused by people but an accident nontheless. Not murder, not home intrusion. Although I'm finding it very hard not to blame those people.

Again thank you everyone, I'll be trying my best to answer until she comes out or I go in.

EDIT 2: We live in a pretty poor area. Drugs and shit like that are common there and a lot of people lose family and friends. I only have an uncle left but he lives in the us, she as far as I know doesn't have anyone like that, ill try to find out

__

Sorry for bad grammar or typos, I'm pretty shaken up right now. She is 16 her entire family was killed while she slept at our friend's house. I live a few houses down the road from her house and went to check when I got waken up by police sirens. I got some info and was asked a few questions then like I was on autopilot I went to pick her up, thankfully our friends parents parents didn't get in the way after I told them, they know both of us like their own, I could see the shock in their eyes, and the mom started crying. dad went to wake her up and walked her outside. Waiting for her to get clothed and come was probably a minute but it felt like hours, my heart was sinking. I walked her to my car opened the door and sat her down hands on her shoulders and tried my best to tell her what happened. I was choking back tears but I felt I needed to be strong for her. I'll never forget that look in her eyes, wide open and so empty but so full of. i don't know. i hugged her got in and started driving. We were both silent the whole time cause I didn't know what to say, it was heartbreaking for me how her eyes were crying but she was just looking ahead frozen. No crying noises, just tears flowing down and she was completely still. She has to be in shock or something. I slowed down when I had to turn to drive into our houses road, but I saw her in the corner of my eye with this look, her eyes widened and heard her throat close up, so I just kept going. She fell asleep after maybe a bit more than an hour, and now it's been a bit more, maybe something like 40 minutes considering where we are and I had to stop for gas, I wanted to call someone when I was out of the car but I couldn't think of anyone in that moment. I got back in and now I'm typing this out to try to figure out what to do. my head is rushing and my heart is sinking. I just wanna keep driving and never stop. I wanna get her away from all this and stay with her forever and give her everything I can. im 18 so maybe I could. she has no family left, no grandparents no anyone. The thought of her being alone breaks me and I can barely breathe."

It was my very first sexual encounter, as I was 12. This trauma spiraled my life into a lot of turmoil, obviously. Because of this, among other smaller factors, I developed gender dysphoria and attempted to live as a male, but it was just a suit of armor.

In my eyes boys wouldn't look at me sexually if I was a boy, nobody would want to touch my vagina if I was a boy, nobody would want me to bear children if I was a boy, I could be safe if I was a boy. Nobody would hurt me if I was a boy. 

About half way through my school year I asked some teachers to call me by a male name, but now I've come to terms with my womanhood and it doesn't fit. I'm so embarrassed about my identity crisis and the teachers have already had to get used to a name change. I have no idea what to do. For six months I built my life around transitioning to male and I was public about it, so now I have to take it all back. 

It's humiliating for me. I have absolutely no idea how to approach people about it but I just want to move on. 

TLDR: I was sexually assaulted as a child which caused a long period of gender issues and unhealthy sexual feelings. I'm struggling with accepting my body and I have to detransition socially but I'm super lost. Any advice?"

I have to figure out how to gain custody of my 10yr old brother and its tearing me apart. I posted my story in r/offmychest but I'm at a loss for words, so I figured I might as well post here too since I have no idea what the hell's going to happen going forward:

2019 hasn't been a good year for me. My fiancee's and my car got totaled in a hit and run in November last year. My mother and my little brother ended up moving in with us in our new house because she had problems with her boyfriend a couple states away (my parents were divorced.) My mother suffered from severe depression and bipolar disorder and didn't make the best financial decisions a lot of the time. My fiancee was hesitant to let her move in, but ultimately was okay with it to make sure my brother had a home.

Within the first few days, it was hell. They both fought every day and I couldn't handle the pressure. I cracked mentally a few times and said some pretty hurtful things to her, and had to take over parenting with my brother because my mom locked herself in her room each day, either sleeping, crying, or smoking. My fiancee eventually demoted herself to a girlfriend, and said that she was on the verge of breaking up with me. March came along, and I found out that my Dad killed himself at the end of the month. He suffered from alcoholism and smoked like a chimney, and it caught up with him over time. He was constantly in and out of the hospital due to heart issues and surgeries, and eventually could barely function. He took his life on March 25th.

The process of figuring out what to do with his death at the funeral home was a disaster. Everyone fought and cried. Eventually we had him cremated, and things at the house got worse and worse. My Mom announced at the beginning of June that she got back with her boyfriend and left promptly the next day, leaving my relationship and home a wreck. The months that passed were a disaster financially and emotionally between me and my girlfriend. My depression and suicidal thoughts hit a peak, and found myself about ready to buy a gun and kill myself, but I checked myself into a mental hospital. A lot of shit happened when my mom flew up without me knowing, and I ended up being worse off than I went in. A few weeks later I went to a followup appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about how I was feeling, and ended up being forced to go back to the hospital because I had suicidal thoughts. I didn't want to kill myself, I only told him that the medication prescribed to me worsened them. The thought of going back there was terrifying. Having to take 10 days off in close proximity to each other out of the blue made my work life hell, because everyone was pissed at me and I couldn't tell them what was going on and why.

Fast forward to now, I got a call earlier today that my Mom hung herself. My brother and her boyfriend found her and I couldn't imagine what they had to go through processing what the fuck they saw. My brother's only 10 years old and not only did he have to go through a divorce and constant fighting between my parents, but her had to move a number of times as a result, had to go to his Dad's funeral, and now he saw his Mom's dead body. But he sounded completely fine on the phone. I'm fucking dying inside. I hate myself because the last conversation that I had with her was pretty negative, and on Thanksgiving of all days. I never called her back to check up on her, and to tell her that I loved her. My parents weren't the best in their later years with myself, my sister, and little brother, but when my sister and I were little, they were the best parents I could have asked for. My girlfriend has been extremely supportive throughout this whole time today, but I feel so fucking empty and hurt. I feel angry that my mother left us to take care of my brother, and that he's had to suffer as a little kid. I feel agonizing sadness knowing that I'll never be able to talk to my Mom or see her ever again and tell her that I love her. But most of all, I feel confused to why all of this had to happen.

My sister's flying down tomorrow to make arrangements to cremate my Mom's remains, and try to figure out what to do as far as my brother goes. I have a house and live very close to an elementary school, and have a good job, but none of that makes me feel any better. I'm scared. I'm fucking terrified. I'm not ready to become a parent, and neither is my girlfriend or my sister, but here we are about ready to take on this role, trying to parent a very damaged child, and sacrificing our adult lives. It sounds selfish but I keep telling myself that it isn't fair that this is how things have to be, but part of me keeps telling myself to be strong for my brother. I have to figure out the process of gaining custody over a child and accommodating him. I just don't know what to do."

I was the first responder to a single car vs. tree rollover on 2/20/2019. My partner was calling into dispatch while I got out to assess the scene and initiate traffic control to ensure safety for the other emergency responders. There were two patients in the car, but they were trapped because the car was propped up on it's side with the roof crushed against a tree. I couldn't see the pts at first. I was able to get one arm through the windshield (which was absent and about 14"" tall at this point). There were pulses on both patients, but the driver's pupils were blown and had taken most of the impact directly onto her skull and spine. I went back to tell my partner to request life flight. When I went back down, the driver had no pulse. We were not able to extract the patients for another 11 minutes. In that time I realized that I recognized some of the items that had been ejected from the vehicle. A hat, some sports equipment, and then in a fraction of a second I realized that it was my best friend's car. I stayed calm, but I definitely got tunnel vision and decided to remove myself from the scene so that I wouldn't get in the way of the extrication. The driver was pulled out first and I watched from outside of my body as the AED leads were applied and then removed. And that was it. She went into a bag and driven back to our fire dept to wait for the medical examiner to take her away. I sat there, alone, with her for 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't stop working from the time my pager went off that morning for nearly a month. At this point everyone around me that was friends with her has moved on, and I am just now starting to sift through the mountain of mourning and trauma and sadness. I don't know why this happened. I don't know where to turn. Everything got put on hold for a month, and now it's like someone hit the play button on my life and I am not ready for it but it's happening anyway. My relationship is falling apart, I'm falling behind in school, I don't leave my house unless someone manually extracts me, I don't eat, I can't sleep without nightmares, I can't be present. I'm always thinking about her blue lips and her eyes. I didn't recognize her eyes when I first made patient contact. I can't believe it took me so long to realize the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm meeting with my chief today. I don't know what to ask for, but I know that I have all the resources I could ever need. I want the patient report, but I have to ask her mom and dad for that because of HIPA. They would say yes, but I'm not ready to have that conversation. I probably need therapy, but the thought of saying all of this (and more) to a stranger that I don't know is somehow mortifying, even though I am able somehow able to post this on reddit. I just need friends. I can't put this on any of my friends though, because they're all grieving the loss of their friend too.

&amp;#x200B;

I just need help sorting all of this out in my mind. How do I process this? How do I ask for help? How do I come to terms with what I saw and move on in this career path? How to I salvage my relationship? I'm 20 years old. I miss her so much."

it was going alright from my view. but then last night she was at a party and started snapchatting me. she started to send me vids of her hanging out with his guy which made me a little uneasy but i didn’t say anything. i am doing homework and so not on my phone for about an hour. after i’m finished i look at my snapchat and there is fifteen videos of my gf making out and getting handsy with this random bloke.

i didn’t respond. i couldn’t . i did not know what to do. i still don’t 
i’m just so fucking angry. i want to go to this guys house and beat the shit out of him but i know that’s a bad idea. it’s got me fucked up. she doesn’t seem to care as she also put some of the stuff on her story for 500+ people to see. 

i don’t know what to do. i want to talk to her but i’m scared. 

edit: damn this really blew up huh. i don’t think i’m gonna be able to read everyone’s comments but i’ll do my best. thank you all for the support it means a lot to me.

edit 2: due to the amount of comments most are about the fact that she cheated on me. it wasn’t even the fact that she cheated on me. that’s not what makes me angry and upset. it’s the fact that she was so brazen about it and uncaring. she was probably gonna end the relationship in the next three weeks anyway

edit 3/update: she is copping it hardcore. about 100 people knew of me and her relationship, i had about 50 messages of my friends sending her story to me saying “dude do you know about this “ and stuff. i explained it to each and every one. now she is pretty much getting abused by everyone for the shitty thing she did. i am not apart of but neither am i going to stop it. she deserves it."

Tomorrow, there’s an assembly where the ‘best students’ will get an award (one for each subject + things like kindness, etc). My mum expects me to get one. The problem is, I’ve been trying to keep up with everything and, although I do have good grades and get close-to-perfect results, I’m definitely not the smartest in the class by any means. Basically, what I’m trying to say, is that there’s no way I’m going to get any awards. I’m probably going to have a panic attack or something tomorrow when that fact settles in though. 

The last time (and first) I didn’t get an award was 2017. I remember it vividly, and how she had slapped me, scolded me and made me sit outside to be bitten all over my mosquitoes. She was so, so, SO disappointed. I’m terrified if that’ll happen again, and I’ve tried to prepare myself all throughout the years since that incident. She’s told me that if I don’t get one, she’ll be extremely mad. That usually means horrid things. I’m not really sure what kind of advice I’m going to want, but potentially ways to calm down during my long lecture. Plus how to not breakdown in front of my class.

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the responses and Gold. I had a good night’s sleep and feel a lot better now. I don’t think I’m going to  call/tell anyone yet, but I’ll be sure to do that if I need to! Once again, thanks for all of your wonderful advice. I’ll be heading to the assembly soon! I’m in a hopeful state right now, so maybe I’ll even get an award.

ANOTHER EDIT: Awards have been given, and somehow I managed to actually get 2! My mum isn’t happy that someone else ended up getting the Maths Award she was so sure I should get, but she can’t do much considering I did end up getting some awards. I’m so sorry that I made this a big deal, I was just terrified yesterday."

Family has no idea how to proceed. The situation is disturbing to me. Would appreciate any advice or perspective Firstly, some context.

My mother divorced my father because he had a pornography problem and she found large books of his containing images of naked children and adolescents. The books were seemingly produced in a foreign country. She took them to her therapist and her therapist said they probably did not constitute child pornography, because the images were not necessarily sexual or suggestive. 

My father then gets remarried to a very trashy and questionable woman with four children, one of whom is a preadolescent girl. I was a child at the time (joint custody), but I observed weird and inappropriate behavior from my father towards the girl. Excessive touching, long baths with him scrubbing her like a car, long bed time stories, tickling, 'accidental' nudity, things of that nature. After reading up lately, this is textbook pedophile grooming behavior. I told these things to my mother and she contacted child protective services. After an investigation, they determined that he was ""grooming"" his step daughter, and they told my father's wife about the grooming. My father obviously denied this to my brothers and I, and simply said my mother was trying to smear him out of spite. My fathers wife was incredulous, but she was something of a psycho narcissist in her own right. My step mother and father divorced about a year later because she had an affair (according to my dad). 

My brothers were conflicted about my mother reporting him and ultimately they thought she was wrong for doing so. I always thought it was the right move. My mother would be proved right later.

Fast forward to present. My brother produces a daughter with his wife. My niece is about 2 years old now. My father was very excited about her being a girl and has been very intentional about seeing her lately. He takes pictures of her and kissed her on the mouth at one point. I was around when he somewhat assertively told my brother that he wants to arrange time for him to babysit my niece and for her to spend the night at his house. He said something along the lines of, ""I just want to arrange regular times to come over and interact with my granddaughter. You guys don't have to talk to me or host me. I just want to spend time with her."" Just a grandfather wanting a relationship with his granddaughter right?

He said he wants to get her involved in ballet lessons. He's normally very private and standoffish with his family, so this enthusiasm seemed weird to me. He has also never been that interested in his grand sons from my other brother, but they live several hours away. That he might be interested in her for unwholesome reasons was in the back of my mind, but I tried to brush it off. Surely not his toddler granddaughter right?

Then a few days ago a disturbing discovery was made. I was at my brothers house. My dad left his Amazon account logged on at my brothers house and my brothers wife looked at his Amazon search history and then started crying. His history contained a bunch of products of sexy toddler outfits, and also about thirty different products of 4-5 yo girls panties. Not normal toddler outfits, but sexualized outfits and panties. Just 2 weeks worth of browsing, he may have deleted his history. There was also a wish list full of children's panties. He had even ordered a set of children's panties and they had been delivered recently. They were delivered about two weeks before he left the mainland United States for a vacation. That in and of itself raises a host of questions. Is he using them as a prop for some sick fantasy? Is he victimizing somebody? How does my niece play into this all? The age range of the ordered panties were a few years older than my niece.

He has also regularly been vacationing in Hawaii by himself, which now seems a bit suspect. Is he hopping over to Thailand or the Philippines for sex tourism? None of us know. 

So the situation is very fucked. Because it looks like my father has been plotting a strategy to groom and molest my niece. He's seemingly gone from friendly grandpa to scheming pedophile. All of his overly interested behavior towards my niece just screams ""child molester seeking to groom"". He is a very accomplished, intelligent, and erudite man, so nobody would suspect him of this at face value, but pedophiles can be cunning and hiding in plain sight. Or are we overreacting? And now it is even clearer that his former behavior with my ex-step sister was predatory grooming, if not full blown molestation (CPS investigation didn't uncover molestation). Obviously unsupervised visits with my niece are out of the question at this point and my sister-in-law is disgusted. My other brother was alerted about this, but he was 3 male children and my father doesn't seem interested in them. But my brothers and I don't know what the next step should be. But do we stay silent? Confront him? Hire a private investigator to see what he's up to abroad and at home? Try to find CP on his laptop?

It's all so fucked. Writing this was somewhat cathartic.

Any advice would be appreciated. Merry Christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:

Thank you for the perspectives and advice. Good points are being raised. But with regards to the 'sever all ties option', that would be very challenging for me, because unfortunately, at this time I am completely financially dependent on my father in all ways. So I would want some pretty bulletproof evidence of criminal activity before I took that route, as that would fuck up my life, but I am willing to go there. It is also worth noting, at this point he has had essentially no unsupervised interaction with my niece, so no grooming has taken place. He certainly won't have any unsupervised contact going forward.

As if I needed to see any more evidence.. It has also dawned on me that my father has been regularly visiting El Paso alone, under the guise of helping out his mentally challenged cousin, whom he has taken a sudden random interest of late. But El Paso is next to Mexico, and Mexico has child sex tourism. We also googled his email address and saw he was posting on pinterest about ""beautiful children, babies, children with blue eyes"" etc. Then we tried to look at his account and his pinterest account was banned for violating ""community guidelines"".

Recently and kind out of the blue I’ve began to accept I was gay, and I wanna come out. I’m mad at myself for not having done it earlier. However my girlfriend is so in love with me and she will be crushed, not to mention her feelings will be very hurt and she’ll think it’s her fault. I care so much about her and don’t want to hurt her so Idk how to about this. Do I tell her or just break up with her for no reason? And if I tell her how?

About a month ago I met this guy (18, M) in a sport club at school. We started chatting through whatsapp and it became clear that he likes me and tries to make a move. He confessed a few times and I turned him down every time, but we were still friends. But then one day, he told me that he was diagnosed with depression and has to use medicine. I know little about depression, and of course I try to understand his situation, but he started making me feel very uncomfortable, cause I don’t like him at all. I tried to ignore his messages, or if I have to, answer as short as possible. But at one point, he started texting me really negatively, like “you didn’t answer my messages and I cried like 2 days. You are responsible for my emotions.” At that time I was like wtf and tried to comfort him a little bit, but he started doing that more frequently. I’m at the point where I hate him so much and I don’t want to have any human contact with him any more. Please understand that I don’t discriminate people with mental illnesses, but I really don’t want to have ANY responsibilities if anything happens to him. After all I not a psychologist, and I have my own feelings too. What should I do in this situation?? I really need an advice!!

UPDATE: Thank you all for your support! I talked to my guidance yesterday and also showed her some of his messages. After discussing some possible solutions, she told me that she will set a mandatory appointment with the guy to talk about the problem sometime next week. He texts me a few times, but I didn’t see nor replied. Again, thank you a lot for supporting me! I really appreciate your understanding!!!"

They went to homecoming.  2 months in, for various reasons including she just lost interest, hr was using language she wasn't comfortable with and ultimately she decided to focus on making school her priority. 

They share a group of friends. He's made it clear he ""can't"" be around her, so she's isolated at school. For a bit of other info, she and my other daughter used to joke that he was cute but""looked like a school shooter.""  White, average, quiet, last guy you'd expect etc...

Anyway, after she broke up with him (he's in an art magnet program), he began drawing things and posting them on Instagram essentially indicating that without her every day was the same ... Boring, dead inside, depression.  Also, she's never had a BF but he has had a GF that he remains on good terms with. 

So my daughter tells me he came to school this week in black jeans, black boots, blacj shirt, and a black beanie. She said she was immediately frightened bc that's SO far from his normal dress. She ""jokingly"" said "" so if I die it was X...and he knows my schedule.""

Here is the backstory. 

2 years ago on a trip, her (now) boyfriend and I were drinking and hanging out. We have had consensual sex before, and a lot of my memory of the trip at this point are foggy (from alcohol or just how much I’ve repressed this) but at one point in our drinking we were kissing and I didn’t want to go past that because I was getting serious with someone else and I started to feel like it wasn’t fair for that person if I was doing this. He forced himself on me. My best friend was the first person I told. She asked me if it was really that big of a deal, and for me I didn’t want to worry anyone so I lied and said it wasn’t. She was very encouraging of me to just try and “get over it” if I was saying it wasn’t a big deal because her, my rapist and 4 others were signed onto a lease that started in a month. 

So I held in all the thoughts of it, and I started dating someone who I told all this to. They started to notice that I was affected way more than I let on, if I was one drink in and they started to even touch my shoulder I would break out into a full on panic attack. I could no longer be one on one with people, it would cause me to panic (especially in small rooms). I had to figure out every possible exit. It progressed to a point where if I saw my rapist with a girl I would panic and retreat as far away as possible. 

This only got worse as we started to live together. My rapist started to only get closer to my best friend (whom I shared a room with). He was always in my room to the point where I couldn’t be anymore. I would be out of my house until 3am at times or just never come home to avoid seeing him. He would never give me privacy even when I couldn’t avoid him in my room, every time he looked at me I felt genuine fear. And I couldn’t get out of it, housing was expensive anywhere else and I was in my senior year of college and didn’t have time or energy to move or find someone to take my spot on the lease. I was trapped in a perpetual hell. It eventually got to the point where I truly thought the only way out was to kill myself, this is when I went to therapy and I was eventually diagnosed with mild PTSD from the situation. 

As I said, he and my roommate only got closer and closer. I started to take a high dose of antidepressants which helped, a lot but, it just put a rug over the elephant in the room. He was still constantly there and eventually my roommate told me they had been dating for months and just didn’t tell me. It felt the same as if someone had told me someone I loved died. It was emptiness, burning ears, the drain and the ring of your ears, everything just stopping and the world stopping for you in that moment. Pain. 

I felt hurt, I felt betrayed and I didn’t vocalize it for a long time, because I’ve learned from experience that the response will be to ignore it. The next set of emotion I felt was fear for her. Despite her telling me to keep it in, she did always seem to genuinely care for me and be there for me when I needed her, I just think she hasn’t experienced (luckily for her) the horror that I did (as well, she was a virgin and didn’t understand sex much at all) so I can understand why she responded the way she did originally. 

Eventually, it got to a breaking point where I told her this is hard for me to be supportive of her relationship, she was dating my rapist. She took this as I wanted her boyfriend or I was jealous or I wanted them to break up. And it’s not like I want those things I just want her to understand, I want anyone to understand. I haven’t been able to tell people because I don’t want to lose everyone. I feel like I’m at a loss. I don’t know how to go on from this. I’m still deeply affected by the rape, and I’m deeply affected that my friend thinks of me this way. And, honestly, I almost do want them to break up. I don’t want him to have anything. I want him to suffer the way I have been. I want his heart to be ripped out of his chest. I want his trust in anyone to be destroyed. I want him to feel what I feel on a daily basis and what I have to go through every day. 

But I guess I just also want my friend to be happy, and if it’s with him I don’t know how to process that emotion. And now, he has gotten into every other friend group I’m in, they don’t invite me out they invite him. Any time I tell someone that he raped me, they distance from me, not him. Like I’m this horrible person for bringing up something that I couldn’t even utter out loud for years. It took me so much bravery to talk the first time, it takes so much more bravery every other time I talk about it. Now, I just don’t know what to do. What do you do when your rapist is now your entire social circle’s best friend? How do you get a new social circle when you put all your trust in these people for 4+ years? How do I go on from this? I’m trying my best but I still wake up panicked and crying from the experience. It’s so hard for me to trust anyone or let anyone new into my life. I’ve lost my relationship because of this and now I’m losing my closest friends. I feel isolated and alone. I just need any advice I can get.

And sorry if this is off tone from the rest of the section, I don’t really go on reddit, I wanted to be anonymous with my story and with what I do, I never get a chance to be out of the attention of others. 

Thanks to anyone who read this, even if you can’t help, having it be heard by someone else is nice for once.


Edit:
Thanks to everyone who read this and replied. I appreciate the tough love that people are giving me. It’s been extraordinarily hard to drop my friends because I came from out of state for school, and they were my family. I have since moved out and gotten my own apartment with a friend from childhood. I have my own room now, this situation particularly haunted me today because I’m my friend’s boss and I had to see her today. Thank you to everyone, and thank you to those who also shared their stories with me. It makes me incredibly relieved that i’m not alone in my feelings. Your words of encouragement and kindness are wholeheartedly appreciated."

How do I get my life back? So basically, I'm a loner. I'm 19f and I have no friends. I moved in 2014 when I was 14, and I had to leave all my friends behind. I've tried to keep in contact with them, but as it goes most of the time, they don't text or answer calls anymore. I didn't let this stop me from trying to make friends here.

In 2015, I started 9th grade. I started to talk with people and I even made a couple of friends. During this time, I developed severe acne. My confidence plummeted... people stopped talking to me and began to avoid me. Instead of asking me how my day was, I got questions like ""did you get in an accident,"" or ""do you wash your face?"" It was bad. This is when **I** began to avoid people and I felt ashamed in my own skin. I did meet my boyfriend during this time, but I was still awkward. In a way, I was relieved that he liked me despite my condition and shyness. We started dating in 2016 and are still together today. I began talking to people again during this time, but friendships never really developed. I found myself only hanging out with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend has his own friends, and I've hung out with them at times too. The problem is that I'd like my own friends and not have to depend on my boyfriend to experience a social life. He has encouraged multiple times to go out and meet people or join a club, but that ultimately fails. Usually people are already in tight friend groups and I feel like an intruder at times.

Fast forward to 2020, I'm in my last semester of college (dual-enrollment in high-school) and I'm graduating soon. During this time, I still had issues making friends and talking with people. I start university this summer and I'd like to take my life back. I still battle with acne, but not like before. I know I'm capable of bringing myself out, but I'd like some advice. How can I get my life back in order? How do I rebuild my confidence?"

Potential video game spoilers below...

Just as background, my son just turned 16 and he has high functioning autism. He loves to play video games, hang out with his siblings and watch movies with the family. For Christmas we (his mother and I) bought him a copy of red dead redemption 2, as it was something he had interest in for a while now and we decided it would be a nice gift.

The thing with autistic people, is that they often get special interests or fixtations, and that was what happened with my son. He became obsessed with the game and specifically the main character, Arthur. What I didn't know is that at the end of the game, Arthur dies from an illness.

My son shut down after this. He cried a lot after it happened and he has stopped using his PlayStation and he just sits in bed all day reading books alone. I know that to some people this may seem an overreaction but it's not anything he can help- it's just how his brain works and that's something I have had to adapt to for 16 years now.

He won't properly talk to my wife or I, even though it's been almost two weeks now that he finished the game. I am worried for him- because even though I know this will pass, I'm his father and I can't help but be scared for him when these things happen.

I don't know what to do in this situation, it feels like there's nothing I CAN do except wait for him to stop feeling so upset... I just want to know if this is normal, am I overreacting? Is this all going to just pass normally, or should I be worried?

Thank you if you do reply to this


Edit: Thank you for all the comments! I spent all morning with my wife reading over them and we've decided to talk to him about it. Both of us researched the game so we can understand why he is so upset, and we're going to try talking to him about it when he gets home from school. Thanks for all the comments!!"

**EDIT:  Yo!!!!** 

I just really want to thank all of you for your comments and suggestions.  I really didn't want to sound or act like the true nature of x-mas is giving with the idea or expectation of receiving .  That being said, next year (per many of your suggestions), i've already decided that i'll be heading to my home country Eritrea for the winter.  I've worked at the same hospital now for over 8 years, so taking a month off shouldn't be a problem. 

from the bottom of my heart i'd like to thank you all for chiming in and not making me feel shitty about my feeling.... a little salty about not getting gifts.      Like i said, i bought them because i never want a friend of mine to feel like their ""nobody""; something a friend of mine felt so strongly that he committed suicide back in nursing school. 

I sincerely can't thank you all enough, i hope and pray that you all had a great holiday and an even better new years to come! 


Thank you all once again! 

and for the silver! i don't know what it is or what to do with it... but i consider that (and your comments) one of the greatest gifts i've ever received! 

bless you all!"

Any advice on how I can ask her to let me cut it myself? I considered telling her that during the quarentine we can see how we like it and if she doesn't like it I can grow it back out, but I'm not sure how to approach it. Please help! Thank you.

( He's very gentle and doesn't like to bother anyone) .This morning i saw him and he looked very upset and I asked him whats wrong and he replied that he was walking in our backyard and then he saw our neighbor's son (about 15 of age)  on my neighbors roof. the boy calls out to my dad to greet him  and says "" did you see the chicken feet over there?"" and my dad is puzzled and is like what chicken feet??   the boy then points to my backyard and my dad looked and there and behold a chunk of fresh chicken feet there. i say they're fresh because they still looked like they were just put there and the smell was horrendous. and then my dad looks back up to the boy and asks "" did you throw this here?!!"". the boy didnt say anything and turned around and left.   my dad cleaned it up and left and after that was when i saw him and we starting talking. he began to tell me about the times the neighbors throw bagged up human shit.  and the more i heard him talk the more furious i got.in the past my dad has tried to talk to them many times, they wouldnt listen. he says this has been happening for over 10 years.  many years ago he went to city hall 4 separate times and they wouldnt do anything because my neighbors would not stop. plus theyre trouble makers. they go to prison for a couple months then come out  and its like a cycle they dont stop. we dont have the money to just move houses nor build a taller wall around the house. ( our existing wall is like about 3 meters)  and they still sometimes break into our backyard and steal fruits from our trees.I'm so angry I'm considering throwing eggs at their house but I don't wanna cause more problems. plus i had a huge argument with my dad about this. he believes in making peace and maybe by seeing good will they may have a change of heart but i believe in putting boundaries.  my dad says you cant win against these people they're always in prisons and getting complaints for 10 years and nothing has changed.I'm sad to know my father is baring this. its breaking my heart. i could use some advice. otherwise i feel like imma go crazy and egg their house"

First I want to thank everyone who commented and helped me through one of my darkest days. I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't reached out, or if I hadn't stayed busy at work that day. 

I called and tried to set up an appointment for that week. They were all booked up until yesterday. 

My doctor and the therapist that briefly came to see me were amazing. I'm starting some medication that should help, and I'm going to start some therapy. I feel a lot better today because I made big steps in taking charge of my mental health. 

I'm working on building a better support system for myself, and learning how to meditate and deep breathe has helped me already. 

Thank you guys so much for your help and support 💕"

For the past few months a couple nights out of the week I have a dream I’m lying in bed and there is a man standing over me, touching me while he is also touching himself.

EDIT: To answer some frequent questions. I am 15. I do not have a lock on my door. 

I appreciate all the advice everyone has given me. I will be trying the tape trick since I don’t really have the money for security cameras. If the tape shows the door is being opened I will tell my grandparents. I don’t want to tell them now in case I really am just having hyper realistic dreams."

I assumed he didn’t have Facebook because I looked for him and had no search results.  Then one day, I found him (he had it on extreme private setting) and it said he is married. I immediately felt uneasy, and I don’t really know what to do.  I’ve been avoiding him and ignoring his texts.  I don’t know whether I should just confront him or just tell him I’m not interested. 

Either way, I’m ending it.

Edit: a lot of people are asking me if he is active on Facebook, he’s widowed, etc.  He was unlisted, and the only reason why I found him is because he must of looked me up because he was recommended friends.  His wife’s page is less private and she’s obviously married to him.  So yeah."

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit but I don’t know what to do anymore.

She’s been in a bad mood all day now and even yelled at her boyfriend earlier today that he’s too lazy (he came home at 3 am in the morning home so he was just really tired). I was in my room scrolling through reddit waiting for my mom to finish wiping the floor so I can clean the bathroom. I didn’t want to annoy her in anyway because I was scared she would hit me again.

But then she suddenly stormed into my room yelling at me how lazy and stupid I am and that my behaviour won’t bring me far in life if I keep being like that (she meant me not cleaning the bathroom) so I explained to hear that I’ve been waiting for the floor to dry but she kept accusing me of stuff so I got mad too and told her to go off and not to bother me with that anymore.
She ran out my room screaming: "" you know what, I wish I had a miscarriage when I was pregnant with you, you’re just a pain the ass""

I was just shocked, and I slowly felt like the most worthless human being ever. I tried not to cry in fear my mother would see me. She never said something..something this offensive to me. I heard her saying incredibly offensive things to me for example about my weight (since I’m 7) or that she didn’t want me and that I should go live with my father. But telling me that to my face just crushed me mentally. I wish I could just erase myself so my mom could be happy again without me.

But tbh it’s not the first time I heard that. When I was eight I heard my mom talking to my older sister asking her if it was a good choice to have me. I know that I’m a mistake because well I actually shouldn’t even be here. My mother tried to abort me but I was still born. (&lt;— that is  one of the reasons why I think she hates me)

I just feel like nobody loves me anymore, I can’t even remember the last time she told me she loved me and I really think she came to hate me.

I‘m sorry for my English and stuff I’m not really used to posting stuff on here but I just don’t know what to do anymore. Should I confront her? Should I forget about it? My family is Asian and talking back to older people is just going to end with me being grounded for a month (the last time i was grounded I had to stay 3 Months at home)


Edit: So I’ve been getting all those notifications and I never in my life thought so many people would read my post and comment. You’ve been all so helpful and I’m very grateful, thank you so much Kind strangers for giving me not only advice but also your own experiences in your childhood/current situation. I never thought so many people have/had to go through this and I hope that this for all of you will come to an end.

I‘m unable to reply to all of your comments but I’ll try, i also read about all of your comments and I saw many questions in them so I’m gonna answer hopefully all of them.

My father: I hate him. I disowned him about a week ago so basically I don’t have a father anymore or someone I could call that. He is a terrible smoker and super insensitive, left me when i was seven came back, left me again,came back and then I left him. He is even worse than my mother and I almost remember only bad things about him.

I live in Europe so Child Protective service is not really an option.

I have a really hard time opening up to other people and reddit has been like a really big step for me. I’m not sure if I should tell someone in school, cause I really don’t wanna lose her. She only has me and my sisters. There aren’t any other family from her side.

Yes it could be that my mother has a mental illness,her first husband left her (had a child together, my oldest sister), her second husband cheated on her with my mothers best friend and then left her (they also had a child together) and now my father, they didn’t marry and well they had me. He also left.

I sadly cannot move in with other relatives because they all passed away.i also just cannot leave her behind. Its like I’m chained to this life.

She did hit me, but that was some years ago when she frequently hit me, but she only hit me when i did shit wrong like have bad grades and stuff. Sometimes when she has those anger out burst I’m still kinda scared she‘ll hit me.

Police was once involved because of the hitting. It was my dads fault though, he sued her even though he hit me too. It was a scary time when police just came to my school and asked me where she hit me. So I’m still kinda traumatised by that.

I hope I could kinda answer all the questions, im still going to reply to all of you individually but that was just to sum all up.
I just want to thank you all again, I feel so much better about myself now."

This is my first experience with death (human or non) and I’m taking it horribly. I have to be up for work in 2 hours, and I’ve slept a total of 1. I keep dreaming about my beautiful boy and just bawling. 

He was the sweetest dog, the day we got him from the pound I picked him out because he was so calm and silent. He just stared up at us with his big brown eyes and 6 year old me knew he was the one (my family wanted a rottweiler- I was too scared of it). He was with us for 16 years. Throughout that time 4 babies were born (and he loved all of them), I graduated, got my license (which he loved because he loved car rides), my aunt got married, my mom moved to a giant farm and he was able to graze. His first year of life was spent from a horrible home to the pound - and the rest was spent with a family who loved him and he loved back. I’ll always remember petting him and “getting the paw” when I stopped. He’d always place his hand on you to let you know you were doing great and not to stop. I miss that the most.

I just don’t know what to do, guys. I know it’s not the same as a human dying but I don’t know what that feels like. I don’t know how to grieve and I just keep crying that I’ll never see him again. I don’t know how people cope with loss.

And to all of you who’ve lost pets and know the pain I’m feeling, thank you for reaching out. Feeling like I’m not alone has helped my heart more than I can explain.

I posted some photos of Oreo (my wonderful boy’s name) on facebook and instantly had reactions - old friends reached out to tell me how devastated they were and the memories they had of seeing him at my house. People I hadn’t seen in years were so effected by the death of my dog that even *they* were crying at work. I’m so unbelievably happy that his energy radiated to everyone. He will truly never be forgotten."

Now I'm recovered and my parents don't like it. Long story short, from ages 19-25, I had a an eating disorder. I was obsessed with eating nothing but ""healthy"" foods. Ie, nothing but fruit and vegetables with some occasional meat, and I only ate barely 1000 calories per day at most but many days I ate much less than that. I was extremely tired, sick, underweight, and miserable all the time. Now, I've finally recovered a whole lot. I now eat things like whole wheat bread, granola bars, noodles occasionally just to add some calories. I don't freak out or cry when faced with occasional junk food like a cookie or a piece of candy. I'm just so much happier and healthier feeling. I've gained a healthy 30 pounds but I'm still pretty skinny. It was an incredibly hard journey and I wanted to feel happy about finally overcoming this. But no, my family has to shut me down for that. They never said anything about my diet when I was weak, underweight, sick, and barely eating. Now that I'm eating like a normal person, they've basically been berating me for the food I've been eating. I eat spinach, whole grain bread, green tea, fruit smoothies, high protein meals, etc. But they're telling me I eat way too many sweets and simple carbs. What sweets and simple carbs?!? I don't even eat white bread and on average I eat maybe one or two sweets a WEEK. I've come so far, I just wanted to be happy with myself for the first time in years, why can't I even have that? My brothers weigh way more than I do and buy fast food literally almost everyday and my parents have NEVER said a word to them about their diet.

I'm just really upset and hurt. I worked so hard, I thought they'd be happy for me, but no, once again, they have to rain on my parade. I'm crying right now as I'm writing this. What can I do? What can I say to them? Can someone please just be happy or proud for me? Everything I do is just shit apparently."

So I live in a 4th floor apartment in near a busy city.  I’ve lived here with my sister for about 2 months. And two really weird things have happened over the last two weeks that make me sure someone is sneaking into the apartment during the day while the two of us are at work. 

It started with the hair stopper in my shower... My sister and I have separate bathrooms, with here’s being behind her bedroom door in the back bedroom. On Friday morning, before going away for a weekend, I took out the stopper out of the drain and put it in the tub to remind myself to clean it before I took my next shower. On Sunday, when I opened the curtain, it had been cleaned out. I was surprised and figured that my sister had cleaned it for me. Gross, but thanks I guess. When i asked her about it the next evening she didn’t know what I was taking about. No one else was in the apartment. It was strange but I let it go. 

Then, yesterday, when my sister came home from work, it was very clear someone had been in our apartment. We’ve had issues with our dryer, so maintenance has been in and out for a few weeks. But whenever they come, even just to check, they leave an official thing on the door with a note with why they were there. Because strangers have been in and out, we’ve gotten into a particular pattern of shutting all the doors , including both bathroom doors, before leaving in the morning. When sis got home, every door was completely wide open, and fans that were turned on were turned off. It was very unsettling. Nothing is missing. We have 3 big TVs, iPads and laptops were out. We’ve searched for cameras. The only reason I can think of someone coming into our apartment is for something perverted. I should add we have balcony with access to the living room and a bedroom. They lock from the inside and were shut, but I guess it’s possible they came in that way? 

We immediately called the landlord and got the locks changed today. The landlord was really freaked out and was very quick to say no one had been in our apartment. They claim they changed the locks after last tenants but frankly I don’t believe them. Also got a cheap camera on amazon...... but We’re both pretty creeped out. I have this weird feeling that it’s either an old tenant or a maintenance guy coming back on his time off. *barf* 

What do you think could be happening???

Same to the people speculating some sort of psychiatric condition. Thanks for the thought, but no. I've seen several people say ""no one would clean your house but you""... but they didn't ""clean my house"" they took my hair. Very different, and VERY unsettling. 

We've order a Wyze Cam 1080 to keep near the door and cheap alarms to attach to the sliding doors, but Amazon isn't delivering until tomorrow. I'll update everyone if/when we catch anyone! In the mean time, both my sister and I will be sleeping at our BF's apartments, as I didn't sleep a wink last night thanks to all these comments (:  I really hope there isn't someone stalking me.

ANOTHER UPDATEish 9/20: confirmed with the landlord that the there is one spare key to our actual apartment in his office and his two maintenance managers have master keys to the building. So that narrows the field. Only time will tell with the cameras from here on out I guess.

UPDATEISH 9/21: we installed the camera and very loud alarms on our sliding doors! No one been caught yet. I have been paranoid and checking the camera when I’m out all the time haha. I appreciate everyone who has asked for an update :).

UPDATE 10/1: We have not caught anyone on the hidden camera. Which is half reassuring and half daunting, because I still don't know *why* someone was in my apartment. I'll be sure to post if we ever catch someone! Another (slightly..) weird thing has started happening tho.... 

My sis works a ~10 min walk away. Two weeks ago, around the time the original story was happening, after unloading the office dishwasher, leaving, and locking up, she returned the next morning to find a single random item in the dishwasher. This morning, again, she found a single item, but it's an INCREDIBLY creepy handmade mug that looks like a man's face. Probably just the cleaning service, but she claims they've never left anything behind in the 1year+ she's worked there. 
Thanks everyone for your concerned! I don't think this mystery will be solved. :/

UPDATE 11/28: people have messaged me, no there is no real up date. I have a camera now and alarms and haven’t caught anyone and nothing else weird has happened. So I’m also left with a creepy cliffhanger."

She gives me the form back and she didn't just exaggerate... she blatantly lied? She put down that i frequently initiate physical fights with other students and i actively defy rules. This is incredibly untrue, I've never fought anyone before, or would I say I try to cause trouble.

I got all four removed and I was on a lot of anesthesia, I was confused and emotional and crying. 

We drove home, and my mom helped me get into bed safely since I still couldn’t walk on my own and was disoriented. 

Edit: my phone has a passcode on it and I’m not sure how it got unlocked. 

Next thing I know she’s standing over my bed with my phone unlocked in her hand reading my texts out loud. Specifically from a guy I hooked up with last night. 

Keep in mind I’m barely even awake right now. I yanked the phone out of her hand and asked what the hell she was doing. All I can remember next is her being very angry with me and shouting at me but I’m so out of it that I couldn’t process it. It just made me cry hysterically because I felt so violated and could barely understand what has happening. 

About an hour later she came into my room said she was over it and we would talk about it later. I brought up that I felt violated because she broke a boundary, to which she said “since you handed me your phone of course I’m going to read what’s on it”. 

Thoughts?


EDIT / UPDATE: thanks for silver! :-) I have no idea how she got into my phone, I have a theory that it was unlocked because of how I had been videoing myself loopy in the car right before she walked me inside, and I probably handed it to her unlocked when she put me into the bed....That’s the problem, I don’t remember much and what I remember is very spotty. 

I remembered just now how she was specifically yelling at me that I’ve been “lying to her for years”, which I think has to do with the fact that my mom hasn’t really come to terms with the fact that I’ve been sexually active since I was a senior in high school. Which is strange considering that she’s more liberal about those kinds of things, this is truly a curveball from her. I guess it’s not the most exciting thing to see your daughter talking dirty with some dude you don’t know. She’s respected my space very well ever since I moved out three years ago for college, but definitely snooped on me when I was younger. I theorize maybe taking care of me gave her a nostalgic feeling and that dirty text kinda ruined it for her or something. 

I don’t really plan on bringing it up unless she does first, because I’ll just shut it down and explain that I’m an adult and my sex life is none of her concern"

I'm 14 and I have no idea what to do. This is probably going to be the longest Reddit post that I've ever written, and I'll probably get around 2-3 comments, but good enough I guess, I just need some guidance.

Context: I live in the UAE with my little brother, dad, and mom. We are not Emirati, my dad is Palestinian and my mom is Turkish. I only speak Turkish and English, and I usually don't associate myself with my dad's part of the family, as they are much more toxic and unbearable than my moms side of the family, which I love and cherish. They're both 45 years old.

Ok, so it all started about 1 month and a half ago:

I noticed that my mom and dad were going through some trouble, because they were both moping around all day. My mom would refuse to talk to my dad. After 2 days of wondering what was going on between my mom and dad, my dad finally sat down with me and talked to me about what was going on. He said that he felt incomplete because, whilst ""marrying a beautiful woman, and having 2 beautiful children"", he felt like he needed to fulfill his purpose, which is being the father of an Arab kid. Now, he didn't mean a half-Arab kid like me and my brother, he meant a full Arab kid that followed the culture. And to do this, he wanted a second wife, which is legally allowed in the UAE.

I was shocked at that point. I tried to look as if I were trying to understand what he was saying, but every ounce of respect I had for him was gone at that moment. At that moment, I immediately picked a side, which was my mother's. But I couldn't let my dad know, since he kind of rules with terror around the house, and he would make my life a nightmare if I let him knew that I hated him for putting my mom through the things he put her through.

Anyways, around a month and a half later, both of them come home sad. I see my mom talking on the phone with one of her friends, or my angel of an aunt. She was crying like she was 6 weeks ago when my dad told her that he wanted a second wife. Apparently, they had one final fight. My mom essentially (and rightfully) kicked my dad out of the house. They aren't going to divorce, since if my mom divorced and won custody (which I would want her to, and she probably will), we wouldn't be able to live in the country anymore. The rule was that they would live separately, and me and my little brother would go to my dads house biweekly.

The next morning, my dad came to pick up his stuff, and he was supposed to be moving into his new studio apartment. He came into my room for another talk, 1 and a half months later. This talk ended around 10 minutes ago, and it's the reason why I'm here to ask for advice. I could tell that he was trying to subtly get me on his side, as he explained his point of view (which was basically an open relationship) as this super rational decision, and then he explained my moms point of view as this ununderstanding, restrictive thing. If I weren't living with him my entire life, I would've been fooled, and thought that his explanation was actually unbiased. He is a journalist after all. Then he explained how he was going to stay at this house everyday, but then go sleep at his own, which totally contradicted my moms wishes. I told my mom this, and she said that my dad was trying to manipulate me, which I already thought was 100% true before.

The only reason I act neutral is because I need a new laptop since mine is 4 years old, and if I'm pissy to the only breadwinner of the household, I won't be able to get it. I've been playing him and hes been thinking of buying me something even more expensive that we were going to buy. My mom knows this and she supports it. My mom is a strong woman, she says she's used to my dads bullshit.

They're going to go to this super expensive family counseling thing, the woman is Turkish, so she'll be able to understand my moms POV, but since she's experienced, also my dads.

Anyways, what should I do? Should I keep playing my dad like I'm doing right now? And most importantly I really would like to know **what will happen next?** 

Thank you so much!

EDIT: Adding some requested details:

-My dad is a very angry person. Whenever he wants you to do something, you have to drop everything and do it, or else he throws a fit. I had to leave a live session mid lesson because he wanted to record a quick video.

-He for some reason told my mom he wants to be with her and other women. That enough is to make her mad, and to make me mad.

It's around night time, and I loved responding to each and every response. This is what gives me strength to go on. I'll be waking up next morning probably to a bunch more, which I also want to respond to. It makes me feel better about the situation as a whole, and I am so grateful to have countless people showing their support, and providing advice. :D GN EVERYONE

My husband and I recently moved back into my childhood home with my parents while hunting for a home in a different city...
Just to give some background... Since moving back in October, my next door neighbor died of a tragic accident. We still aren’t quite sure what happened... the day he died, my parents got a phone call from his wife saying she hadn’t heard back from him. My parents went next door to check on him but no one answered but his truck was there. My parents left for a play, and got a phone call during the play from the wife saying she found him dead just past the bottom of the stairs. He was lying on his back and his head was cracked open, but no one knows what caused that to happen. My parents rushed to be with her, and help her until her family arrived. He was a great neighbor who my dad got to know pretty well.

For the past 2 weeks, we have noticed some strange things... 
One week night 2 weeks ago, I got home from work not too long after dark, and my brother’s first question was if I knew if our neighbor was home. I said “yeah, she’s home” not thinking anything of it. He responded with, “ok, are you sure?” when I ask him why? He said “nothing” but I knew something was up. After continuing to ask what’s going on, he told me something weird happened when he was out with the dogs. I told him it was weird he asked if she were home... because I even thought about how many lights were on in her house when I was pulling in, and she never has that many lights on, so she must be home” 
He said he saw a man in the woods on the side of her house. He was standing behind a big bush that’s right on the tree line. (We live in a culdesac and there’s no fence separating our yards, and we can see the whole side of her house from our backyard and deck. There’s woods all behind us with no houses.) He said that when he was throwing the ball with our dog (right as it was almost completely dark... and was dark as he was walking up), he noticed an orange light like the tip of an ecig blinking. The man had a square super dimmed flashlight... not bright at all. My brother shouted, “hey! Hey!” And the man ran to the side of my neighbors house and stood still crouched behind the AC unit with his back against her house. The orange light was still blinking. My brother got freaked out and got the dogs in and locked the door. My husband was upstairs and my brother tried to get him to get up and come check on things with him... but my husband was in the prime of having the flu and couldn’t get out of bed... too sick to care so my brother just waited for me to get home.

Another strange thing happened this week, my neighbor told my dad that she had a friend come check on her house while she was out of town. When her friend went to check on the house, there was a truck in her driveway. When the friend asked the man in the truck who he was, he said she had inquired about getting the house painted and he was walking the perimeter to give a quote. Noone ever told her that would be happening. Keep in mind, it was night and dark when this happened. She thought that was weird, but did inquire about getting her house painted so didn’t think more of it. 

Well, 3 nights ago, my neighbor called my dad saying she thought she saw someone in the woods and asked if he could check it out. My brother, husband and dad went out back and looked but never saw anyone. The next day, my dad went to Home Depot and bought a super bright/long distance flash light because things are getting weird. 

** at this point, we still haven’t told her about what my brother saw because we don’t want to freak her out as a widow who just lost her husband, living in a huge house by herself.

Well, tonight around 11PM, my dog is crying to go out. There’s been coyotes so we have been going out with the dogs every-time we let them out. Well... my husband returned super spooked. He said while he was on the side of the house, he was going to pee (haha) but out of the corner of his eye, he saw an orange light... when he turned to look in the woods he saw the orange light and then it shut off. He said it looked exactly like what my brother saw. We went back out... and saw nothing.

Our family is starting to get spooked, and we are closer than ever to telling our neighbor about this... she has cameras on every part of her house besides the side this has all happened on all at night. What could the orange light be? Should we tell her and how do we tell her?

****UPDATE
This morning, I told my parents what happened last night. My dad is going to take the dogs and walk the woods. He works from home. My mom is more on edge about it than my dad, but I think he’s just acting cool to not freak us out more,. 
We are going to keep a close eye on things today and tonight. This morning, my mom said new rule... no one goes outside without a flashlight anymore, so we can get a clear view. 
Responses from my dad this morning... he thinks maybe someone is living in the woods, a deer may have something on it... or there’s a hunter? Again, I think he’s trying to deescalate but he is definitely on high alert. He also understands the severity of the situation now that 3 people have seen something strange... so he wants to ask her over tonight and have the family talk to her about it.

****2nd UPDATE
My mom and I are going over to her house tonight to tell her everything. My mom just told me her husband who passed away once told her that she had previously been broken into while she was home prior to becoming our neighbors, so that’s why they have been so hesitant to tell her and her be scared until now. 
My parents are also looking into getting a camera and light installed.
Thank you all for your feedback... We are considering everything and gained some great insight. I know it’s difficult to understand how we haven’t said anything until now, but heading in the right direction...

**** 3rd Update
We went over to her house and told her everything we’ve seen. We gave her the dates for her to pull up footage on the cameras she does have, to check if she can see anything. She does not have cameras on the side of her house where things have been seen, so she is going to get some installed asap. She is uncomfortable but thankful we told her."

For context, one day we were in math class and she just turns to me and says ""Hey, don't come to school on September 5th."" I ask her why and she draws a grenade on her worksheet, I asked her if she was serious but she smiled deviously.

Later in class I see her doodling more guns and stuff and I'm really scared. I don't know if she was serious, and if she wasn't, it isn't something to joke about. I don't know if I should tell a teacher or a friend. Do I talk to her about it or just stay silent and stay home? I'm just scared and confused.

It's been a week since this has happened and I haven't said anything. We're in an Australian, Catholic highschool if that helps. It's a week until September 5th and I don't know what to do.

EDIT: OK, so I was really not expecting and hoping for this post to blow up. I just wanted a few people's advice but what can I do. So, about me telling my friend, it really was dumb of me to think about. I'm sorry. My thinking process was that maybe I could talk her out of it if she was being serious, but if she is serious she probably won't listen to me. Sorry, I'm just a bit stressed over this. On Monday I'm going to tell my year level co-ordinator about it (since we have Thursday and Friday off for parent teacher interviews). There's just one thing that is bothering me: will they even BELIEVE me? I don't have any proof and I doubt she even remembers telling me and will show them her drawings. All I have is my words. Also, she will most certainly hate me for this, which frightens me, but if she's serious, I need to tell a teacher. Thank you so much for the people who gave me advice :) even though some was harsh, it was needed.

EDIT 2: So, it's Monday. I don't know if I'm really allowed to say what went down exactly (my vice-principal told me not to tell anyone) but to make a long story short, the vice principal pulled me aside during class (before lunch) and asked me about this post. It seems they were notified by someone here on reddit or they were investigating something else and stumbled upon my account. Later that day they pull her aside and according to the vice principal, she doesn't remember. I think they have either resolved this already or are still investigating it, I don't know.  
But, that just means the school has been notified and it has been brought up with my friend :) I think the school will be safe. Thanks everyone for your advice :D!"

He's known since he was 4 that Mommy is sick and she might die from it if doctors can't fix it. Well, they can't.

Grandma and grandpa already died, and we were very sad. Grandma died of the same disease.

My brother (20M) has been living with us and helping out for a long time. He already knew I wasn't likely to make it two years, but now it's just one at the most. I know he'll keep being my son's best friend no matter what.

I don't know what's going to happen to him. His bio dad doesn't want to step in and take him for even a day. My brother wouldn't say no to taking care of him forever if we asked. But he's only 20, and it's not fair to him when he's going to want a family of his own in a few years.

My son is the world to me. My baby brother is too. I want them both to be happy when I'm gone."

It's taken me 5 beers, a few shots of vodka, and a lot of self hate to be able to say this. I was severely bullied as a child. You may say, ""Oh, everyone was"".

No.

This is different.

I've been pushed in front of a moving cement truck, lit on fire, stabbed, tazed, and beaten, and never seemed to be able to get help on matter where I turned.

At home, I was put in my neighbors closet and raped at 6 years old. Multiple times, by the same sex.

I was completely isolated. Anything you could think of was done to me. Anything you couldn't think of was done to me. Ever been stapled in the eyelid? Ever had an entire school force you to become isolated by bullying anybody who talked to you to the point that they stopped?

Anything that came out of my mouth was instantly used against me.

I hate this explanation, because if I stated every horrible thing that's happened to me, the list would be endless..... But dumning it down and generalizing like this just doesn't potray what I really went through.

Years later as an adult, I've never been able to function like I want to. I'm terrified of people..... I can never trust anyone. I'm absolutely horrible in social situations to the point where it's just Fucking creepy and pathetic. I'm so self conscious to the point where I stop my sentences half way through because people might think I'm blatantly retarded, I can't help but mumble most of the time.... I swear I would love to stand up straight and talk loud....... Everything in my fucking body stops me.

I don't have a clue as to social norms because I'm 120% terrified being around people. I always fall back in groups. I Fucking hate it. I'm always the one being stepped on.

I've tried the bullshit people say like, ""oh just look yourself in the eye in the mirror and say you love yourself"".

Fuck you. I've been doing it for years. I've actually gotten great at saying it.... But the moment I'm around people.... That voice I have goes away.

Its affected every job I've had, and I've lost a job recently due to bad people skills.

I've never been in any kind of relationship. I feel absolutely no attraction to anyone, and the thought of being with someone (of any gender) makes me feel fucking sick to my stomach.

I hate being this guy. I'm the creepy weirdo just because my past fucked me up. I didn't ask for this shit to happen.

I've been going to therapy for years, yet have not once EVER been able to bring up anything I've said here. Everytime I go there I want to, and everytime it's on the tip of my young my brsin shuts down and nothing comes out. I just waste my Fucking money.

The best part? I've really only had one person who I've considered a friend in recent years. Until last year when he overdosed a few months before he turned 21.... We were great friends. I mean holy shit.

Anyway I've tried all the ""force yourself into social situations"" bullshit for years and nothing's ever Fucking worked. Fuck me. I was cursed to be this way. I'll never be able to live like a normal person, no matter how much I want to. And believe me.... I REALLY want to.

By this point, if we're being honest, I have this deep desire to just watch the Fucking world burn. Fuck everyone, fuck everything. I live with these Fucking demons everyday and they've paralyzed me from living my life.

**EDIT:** wow! I can't believe the amount of support I've gotten from everyone, and the amount of personal messages I'm receiving. I can't thank you all enough for showing me that there really are good people out there.

To clarify some things now that I'm in a sober state of mind, my family didn't have anything to do wither this. I grew up with two loving parents, but just haven't been able to ever bring myself to tell them any of this. Mostly just due to the embarrassment of it all. Most of the time I would come home and lock myself in my room or we are long sleeves just to hide bruises and scars until they healed.

As for the incident where I was stabbed.... My family was aware of that. I was stabbed in the middle of my 8th grade class. What haunts me the most was remembering the entire class laughing at me when I screamed in pain.

The other student was arrested on an assault charge, and I remember the school begging my parents not to press charges, which they didn't.

The student was placed back into my class after their suspension and nothing changed.

That was really the only time they ever had an idea as to the extent of my bullying, and strictly because there really wasn't a way to hide that from them. But they don't know just how often things occurred.

**Update 2:** As for age, I'm 20, and still living with my parents. I technically shouldn't have graduated from high school, it was passed due to family circumstances at the time. My family was stuck caring for my dying grandmother, and I was in and out of school constantly battling depression.

Stupidly, when I graduated, I wanted nothing to do with school. I started working full time immediately, and thought I could make myself feel better by buying a sports car and a motorcycle....... For some reason I thought it would be the cure to all, and prove everyone wrong.

In return all that really did was lock me into some serious monthly payments.

After nearly two years of working that job (which was swing shift) I decided it was time for me to focus on going to college.

Since I still have several years left on my car payment, I found a mon-fri 9-4 salary job working in insurance. I thought I was making a great move for my future by working during the day, and being able to take a part time college class at night. After close to 2 months in insurance, I was fired for not meeting my sales quota... Partly due in fact to my poor people skills.

Unfortunately, this was back in October, and I have been unable to find work since, nor am I able to go back to my previous job since the position has been filled. I was fired before I had a chance to enroll in some part time classes at my community college, so unfortunately that went down the drain very fast.

**Update 3:** Many of you have suggested moving out of area. I currently live in New Jersey, and have been in the same city since birth.**

My parents are coming close to retirement, and are looking to move down to South Carolina within two years. Their goal is to be able to pay off my car payment so I can focus on college down there. I just can't help but still feel left behind in life. But I am very much looking forward to cutting ties with this area and starting fresh.... It just can't happen for a while.

**Update 4:** I made this original post a few hours before I went to sleep, and it definitely induced some nightmares that I didn't want to remember"

It's pretty bad. I'm pretty upset. Understatement. I don't want to ask people who've actually lost a child, but it feels close to that to me. I won't have contact with her, but she'll be out there.

But here's my question... what can I DO? Like, with my time. My entire life is structured around her, I'm a single parent. I wake up so I can get her on the bus, I chose my job because its hours are during school. I have hobbies, and I do like my job. Do I just add more hobbies? I am just going to be alone now? Do I just get really good at having a clean house? I always thought she'd be there, and never even imagined something like this. I'm going to have to be a new person now.

TL;DR How do you fill a giant hole in your life? With basketry class? How did you do it?

Edit: Jesus this blew up. Just an update, we complained to the head nurse on our way to a different hospital. We are only going back there if our son is born &lt;35 weeks as he would most likely be transferred there.

Also to clarify I didn't want to take it out on the nurses as they were paused outside the door for a couple of minutes and I'm guessing the lady was being a thorn in her side. The job is probably hard enough without 2 thorns lol.

Also also as you may have figured out I'm not a doctor but my girlfriend is not in labor. From what I understand early contractions are a semi common problem and the other Hospital gave her a couple of shots to stop the contractions and let our son cook for a little bit longer."

I can't bring myself to ask coworkers for hand-me-downs, so where can I turn for free clothes. Backstory(TL;DR down bottom): My mother and 2 closest 'actual' friends were all taken from me recentlyish, leaving me to entirely support myself. Upon receiving an eviction notice, I found an apartment that is close enough to my job to walk. I only had $300 and the deposit was $1,300 for first and last months rent. On November 15th I talked the landlord into letting me make payments in order to hold it (not move in until it's fully paid). On December 12th, a months worth of paychecks finally got me a set of keys, but not before she said ""You know you'll owe another $650 for a months rent on the 15th, if you can't afford it and changed your mind that's fine"", mind you I never moved in or signed anything. I begged her to allow me to pay THAT in payments as well and explained I literally can't count $1,300 as a loss and move on, and she slipped in that 'moneys been tough because my husband's out of work and we have no income'. Safe to say she tried playing me, no?

Due to walking everywhere and no eating nearly enough, I've lost a lot of weight, and all my clothes are Ill fitting, which has left me really self conscious on top of being majorly depressed. Is there such thing as a food bank but for clothes or something? I dont care if they're 'lame dad clothes' instead of ""Fresh Threads"", I just can't stand wearing 4 size too big jeans and XL shirts when I can easily fit in a medium now.

TL;DR: I'm in debt to my landlord for the foreseeable future leaving me completely broke and my clothes are extremely big on me, where can I turn to for free clothes that fit me?


Edit: I didn't expect/plan for this turnout and I've gotten some great advice so far, I'm trying hard to reply to everyone but I'm heading out to work soon. 

I also definitely didn't do this with intentions of handouts, but if anyone is genuinely in a position to, I'm in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Near Wilkes Barre/Scranton."

She told me about it and I told her it was probably [brushing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brushing_(e-commerce)). 

Just tonight, she tells me she was at work, where her colleagues tell her the chattering teeth were what the joker sends people before he kills them. Her colleagues said to contact the authorities. She also adds the detail that the package WAS NOT MAILED. It was dropped off and that means not a brushing scam. She told the police and they said it was probably nothing. I’m kind of freaking out now. Does anyone know what to do in this situation? There is no one that would send this to her as a prank. It’s creeping me out.

Update: My mother is okay and is at work. Still not sure what’s going on with this though. More details to follow later in the day. Thanks everyone for the massive support and trying to help us out with this unusual situation.

For those that want to know, my mother works as a cardiologist tech at a hospital, where she works with a team of people that solve heart related issues.

Final update:
Text from my mother today reads as “So here’s the story. A friend knows that I hate it when they take a patient with dentures and they take their teeth and put them in a plastic case and put them on the counter by me. I really don’t like that and they do it all the time. So she saw these joker teeth and thought of me and thought it would be funny to drop them by for me then got busy and forgot to tell me. She lives in [our town]. She saw my post on the [our town] Facebook page and felt bad and sent me a msg this afternoon to tell me.”

Thanks to everyone on r/advice here for all the support. It really means a lot to me and my mom. I am especially glad to see that this was nothing of bad intent and it just turned out to be nothing more than a   mistake from one of my mother’s friends. We are now planning on getting a door camera in the near future."

I have lived in this area (rural) or areas like it most of my life. I love my students even when I have discipline problems. I am having trouble communicating with parents who think I’m racist. I am at a loss. I have three parents this year who I cannot seem to win with. (Well really more but these 3 apply to this specific situation) I have done the good phone calls home, the emails, invited all parents to parties, etc. I have behavior problems in my class, not just these 3 students but several others. The difference in these 3, is when I try to go by my class and our schools discipline plan, I am met with very defensive parents. We have a 3 strike system. 1st strike is a warning, second strike is a parent contact, and 3rd is an office referral. None of these 3 have ever received office referrals, partly because their behavior has not quite warranted it, but also partly because I am walking on egg shells to avoid parent conflict. If I give one strike, my boss gets called or I have an angry parent at my door. They have told me to my face that they do not believe me, their child said they didn’t do it, and that I am lying. This is over things such as a student hitting another (not hearsay, things I have seen with my own eyes), screaming out in the middle of class, or just breaking school policy. They say I am racist and bullying their children. The thing is, these kids are not the worst in my class by far! I have 3-4 write ups a week and these kids have never gotten one. One of them actually has great behavior! Last week I called one of these parents to ask her to send a note to school because her son was absent (school policy) she said that she was too busy for that bull shit, hung up on me, and called me out on Facebook by name for being racist. I have cried all the tears I can over this. My admin says it’s just certain parents certain years. The last few weeks I have just avoided contact at all costs, but I need advice: can I mend this? I want to talk it out with parents but every time I call I get cussed at, screamed at and my boss was then called. Luckily he is supportive. 
Or should I just ride it out? 

One way or the other, I have to maintain discipline in my classroom. In the last month of me “walking on eggshells” I have seen my class go down hill. One of these students tells me he is going to “tell his mom” every time I get onto him or give him (he earns it) a bad grade."

I have a Irish Setter, a smart, obedient bird dog. He listens and is a good boy. Tucker however, is victim to having been NEVER told “no” in his 8 annoying years of life. He goes where he wants, eats what he wants, and gets whatever he wants. He goes wherever he pleases. He will trample his 11 year old sister if he has to. When he wants to go out, he screams until he gets let out. When he is done, he walks to the door and instantly screams until he gets let in. When you open a door for him he bolts through it. My dog, waits for me to enter and comes through after me. I can’t police my gf’s family on how to treat their dog because it’s not my dog. But my gf babying him is the root of all this. He will beg for food and they feed him from the table. He will literally do anything and no matter how bad it was my gf will not ever get mad at her “bubba”. Obviously I don’t like him and because of this and how he sees me as the one male who took his gf away from him, he HATES me. When I come into a room, he will cower and run away. If I go to touch him, he will duck as if I were to hit him. I may seen crazy for saying this but I think he puts on act to get more attention from my gf and keep her away from me. When he does sleep on the bed (not as much as before thank god) he will snuggle my gf and stay as far away as possible from me. If I come close to her, he will walk between us. If I go to touch him, he will instantly yip and wake my gf up. And she scoops him up and snuggles him. Sometimes he comes into bed and wakes me up, and when half asleep me rolls away for .2 seconds, he drops between us. One night, my gf kept putting him on the bed to go clean up his pee on the floor. But he kept jumping off because he is afraid of me and I was on the bed. The 4th time or so she closed the door on him and I got up to put him back in bed. And when I did he instantly stared screaming. I am not exaggerating he started screaming as if I was stabbing him with a vibra blade. It was the most horrible sound I’ve ever heard from an animal and on cue my gf comes in and yells at me for hurting her “bubba” and scoops him up and snuggles him.

I found out the reason why and i don't know how to talk to him about it. Before I get into what's happening here, I want to say that I was not necessarily upset when my gf wasn't invited. I figured they wanted a really small wedding or what not. I get that weddings are expensive and I understand that it's up to the bride and groom to choose the guests. That being said, I am not complaining that she didn't get invited ( though I thought it odd), I'm torn because I found out she wasn't invited because she's black. 
Another friend of mine called me up tonight and told me this. He said that the bride to be was telling him that she didn't want people of color at her wedding. He got rather upset at her on our behalf and felt like I had the right to know. Well I am really upset and hurt. The groom and I grew up together and we've basically talk everyday for 21 years. He's the kind of person who included everyone and never wanted someone to be left out (like absolutely for real though). He often tells me how much he likes my gf and how great her and I are. I want to ask him about it but I don't think he knows that his fiance feels this way. 
To say that I am conflicted is an understatement. I need advice or guidance of some sorts. My gf and I have been dating for 2 years and we live with each other. I want to ask him why my gf wasn't invited but I feel like that's setting him up for failure because in some sick way, I want him to question it too. I want him to know what his fiance said but I fear she is going to lie and have him turned against me. I want don't want to lose my best friend but I don't know if I can stomach being around his fiance anymore. 

I don't know if I should talk to him or just be quite. I never really liked her, she is sort of a space cadet and has a lot of really odd behaviors. She treats him well and that is why I never said anything about bad about her because it's not my relationship therefore I don't want to rock the boat per say.  They are happy together but he also defends her regardless if she is right or wrong. She isnt very rational and that's why her and I often butt heads. I am basically up against an irrational woman who I fear will end our friendship because she may or may not be racist. I am  confused and just unsure of how to proceed from here on out. 

If anyone has advice or similar experiences please reach out. If I am being irrational or over dramatic, let me know. "

Edit: First of all, I am overwhelmed with appreciation at the response this post received. 

I had initially planned on waiting until after the holidays to tell him, but thanks to your all’s advice, I told him tonight. We (me and my husband) met with a school counselor today and she agreed to tell him tonight. Give him the weekend to process and ask questions. Make plans to do stuff but keep some down time. 

So we sat him down and I told him. My son believes in heaven, so I used that angle. I said “Remember how you’ve talked to me about heaven before? And how people that go to heaven don’t get to come back?” He nodded and I replied with “Well I’m sorry baby, but your dad went to heaven this week.” He immediately looked at my husband and said “But at least I still have this dad!!” I agreed and said “Yes you do, and we are here for you and always will be, I promise.” 

I proceeded to tell him that he doesn’t need to try and be strong for us, and that being sad or mad or whatever is completely normal and OK. He then looked at me and his lip started to quiver and he cried. We held each other for a minute, he leaned out and kissed me on the cheek and then asked if he could have dessert. 

I told him if he ever feels sad or angry or ever needs to talk that me or Dad (my husband) are here for him. He asked for dessert again and has been playing games ever since. I fully anticipate him to ask more questions and have a moment of true realization, but for now he seems OK.

I cannot thank this community enough for your help and support during what is arguably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life. I truly appreciate each and every response I received. 

—————————Original Post:——————————

I found out my son’s father hung himself this weekend. 

My son is 8. We separated when he was 3 and our relationship (the one between me and his father) wasn’t the greatest even when we were together. For lack of a nicer way to put it...his dad was a real douche nozzle. When we did separate, he never really paid child support and was in and out of my son’s life as it was convenient for him. You know the type - sometimes he’d play Father of the Year for a couple weeks, then he’d disappear for months. He was an alcoholic; when he was sober he was great...but when he needed a drink on the other hand...he was like a different guy.

My son hasn’t seen or spoken to his father in over a year. So his death isn’t really going to affect my son’s day to day life. Also, his family is from a thousand + miles away and I know his funeral (if he has one) will be held there, so with work and everything else I won’t be making the time to go. 

My plan was to wait until January to say anything to my son. I’m not going to let that asshole ruin my sweet son’s holiday season. He rarely ever mentions his dad, so it’s not like he’ll say “so when do I get to see my dad again?” between now and when I tell him. Also, my husband is wonderful with him and my son actually calls my husband “dad” nowadays. So it’s not like he doesn’t have a father figure that’s there for him.

I guess my questions revolve around...how? How do I tell an 8 year old their dad is dead? I mean, he knows he’s never around already and that he may never see him again...but this is different. He did love his dad, obviously. And I’m afraid this may absolutely devastate him, even with our support. I also planned on telling his school and having him see a counselor at school once a week or more. 

I just have never had to do this before and I don’t personally know anyone who has ever had to have this conversation either. Do I tell him on a Friday so he has all weekend to be sad? Or do I tell him during the week so he has school to keep his mind off of it? Do I tell him he killed himself?? Or just say “I’m not sure”? I just don’t know where to begin. 

And advice or insight would be so appreciated, thank you! And I apologize if this was a jumbled mess of information, I’m on mobile and also have so much on my mind right now."

As the title says, my mom’s cheating on my dad. My siblings and I all know of this now, but we decided to keep it to ourselves in order to not destroy our family. We also tried talking to our mom about it but she kept denying it despite the clear evidence. Video chats, text messages, nudes, etc. So we gave up, hoping that she’ll stop. 

Fast forward a month, nothing’s changed. It just makes me feel awful because I know my dad doesn’t deserve this. I’m honestly thinking of telling him. I’m sure he’ll be deeply saddened, but should I let him know the truth? Not telling him and telling him is gonna hurt either way. 

What should I do?

EDIT: 
A lot of people are saying to just tell him. I am thinking of doing that but not even my siblings are on my side on this. If my family does break completely, I don’t think I’ll be able to handle the guilt even though it would be the right thing to do. Any advice on this?

EDIT2: Let me add more details. So my parents are still happy. My mom still acts lovey dovey with him as any wife would to their husband in a healthy relationship. In this case, my family isn’t necessarily split /broken or anything, but that secret is under the surface which bothers me. I don’t know if my dad knows about the cheating and is acting like he doesn’t and is okay with it. This gives me even more burden on what the hell to do

EDIT3: Thank you all for the advice. I had no idea this post would blow up like this. I’ll make sure to read through all the responses within the next few days/weeks as I am pretty busy now studying for exams and can’t allow this situation to stress me out at the moment. I’ll update on here if I do anything. Thanks again!

EDIT4: I got my siblings on my side and we confronted our mom. Didn’t end well at all. She wished us to die and fought us all. We all have scratches on us from her nails. She admitted it but then changed her mind again. I guess we tried. That’s it for now. Thanks again everyone."

We always goofed around playing pranks on each other and just general roughhousing. 

He’s 21, I’m 27. He lives with my dad and I frequently come over there with my daughter to visit. In the past month I have noticed some behavioral changes.
 
&gt;he always has to sit next to me and if I sit somewhere else he asks me to come over and sit by him

&gt;always wants to put his head on my lap
&gt;will act like he’s going to tickle me while we are sitting next to each other, 
he’ll put his hand underneath me just to touch my butt I assume 

&gt;he did that and got way to close to my crotch for comfort so I got up and sat somewhere else 

&gt;he’s jokingly pinched my breasts
&gt;one time he said “looking good” when I was cooking some chicken and I said oh do you mean the chicken and he laughed and said yeah sure. 

&gt;he’s been open to me about sex lately and how he’s still a virgin and it’s getting to him how he can’t meet anyone and he needs an older woman to show him the ropes

&gt;he came over to my house last night and was like I need someone to practice on and I said oh haha well just wait for the right person to come along 
&gt;he said I was going to ask you something but don’t judge me and I said ok knowing exactly what he was going to ask

&gt;he essentially asked me if he could use me as practice 
&gt;I told him no way, you know that’s incest right? 

&gt;and he was like yeah I know 
&gt;he made sure to specify that he didn’t mean sex 

&gt;didn’t talk about it for the rest of the night

&gt;he awkwardly followed me around the kitchen while I was making a sandwich with a look on his face like he really wanted to say something

&gt;and I was like what’s going on and he was like oh I just have a lot on my mind

&gt;he just kept focusing on trying to get laid asking if I had any friends he could practice on and shit and I’m like nope
&gt;then he pulled up a picture of me in a very tight dress on my Instagram and said nice dress looks good

&gt;so eventually I was like ok I’m going to bed and just went upstairs and he left

&gt;
I don’t know what to do I haven’t confronted him and told him this is fucked up our relationship is basically done now. I don’t think he knows this was wrong and would ruin things as siblings. 
I don’t want to be around him anymore. And how the fuck do I deal with this. Do I tell my parents? Had dinner with my mom today and she knew something was wrong but I couldn’t tell her.

Edit- I texted him to tell him he’s not welcome around me or my daughter anymore. I told him to get help. He blamed me for “pressuring” him to say what he said. He said “you made me say it”. Begged me not to tell our parents. 
I still don’t know if I will say anything to them. 

Edit 2-
I told my parents this 

”Hey guys, whatever you do, don’t say anything to ***** that I’m texting you. 
But you guys need to work together somehow to get him some help. Therapy or something.
He’s no longer welcome at my house and I don’t plan on coming over to your guys house if he’s there. 
I don’t want to talk about it. If ***** actually tells you what happened (which I doubt he will because he’s begged me not to say anything) he’s probably going to make it sound like it wasn’t as big of a deal and blame it on me, because that’s what he did when I confronted him about it and told him how messed up it was. He said it was my fault and I made him do it. but it was a big deal and I didn’t make him do or say anything. I no longer want a relationship with him.
it’s not a small thing that I’m going to get over eventually, this is very messed up and very real.
Please get him to a therapist.” 

I haven’t told them in detail but they are obviously concerned and curious. I told my mom to be weary that he might try to make it not a big deal and she understood. I have a good relationship with both my parents and I know they’ll be on my side but it’s just going to devastate them and I’m trying to slowly get to the point of actually telling them what is going on but emotionally I’m not ready.

I'm mostly having feelings of shame and anxiety 

I got married 6 months ago to my husband and I feel like he did an entire 180 after getting married and is just the opposite to who I thought he was 😞 

I did love this man but now I'm not so sure. I do know I'm incredibly afraid of him. He is so angry and violent most of the time. Always punching things and screaming when something goes wrong. He's much bigger than I am so I usually go into another room and avoid him when he's like that because I know if he ever tried to hit me or anything I'd have little ways of stopping it 

Last night was the most embarrassing night of my life. He'd been yelling for nearly an hour because he'd thrown the controller at the wall and then it wasent working properly he'd gotten so upset he punched a hole in the kitchen wall. I went to our room to get away from him after he did that and just on our bed listening to him yell. Eventually he stopped yelling and came onto the room to find me when he seen me crying he started yelling at me again I got up off the bed to stand up because I was going to leave the room but when I tried to walk past him he grabbed onto and walked me back up into the corner blocking me from going anywhere. I was actually really scared at that point. I put my hands out so there was space between us and he grabbed hold of both my hands and shoved them back. At that point I was sure he was going to hit me or start beating me or something and I was so scared I accidentally peed myself 

😔I've never done that before I was just really scared of him in that moment. When he seen that I'd peed my pants he kind of calmed down because I think he felt bad. He told me to relax and breathe properly. Because I hadn't even realised I'd been holding my breath 

He helped me into the shower and everything after and was really kind and apologised to me. 

I feel so ashamed and can't believe that happened 😣 

But although my husband is being sweet to me now I know the next time he gets pissed off or angry he will flip out again like he always does. 

I don't understand what made him this way because he was always sweet to me for the two years we were dating before marriage 

Why does he act this way now ? Is it something to do with being married now ? How can I make him go back to the way he was before ?"

Is there anyone here with any experience with children with ODD? Any advice would be helpful, I just want to make this situation easier for her. She’s the sweetest kid. 

Thank you!

Edit: yes she is professionally diagnosed, this is more than just bratty behaviour. 
I’m going to try and do some art with her, and help her find some practical coping mechanisms.

Another edit: thank you everyone! I get pretty easily overwhelmed so I’m sorry if I can’t reply to everyone but thank you call from the bottom of my heart!!!
My 3 cousins are the sweetest kids and I want what’s best for them. I’ve contacted both the police and DOCS (department of child services) and my fiancée and I are going to try and get emergency custody for them. 
Thank you all again!!!"

This is the first home I can afford. I moved in last weekend and everything was going fine until we found out we were both into men. After that he’s been very touchy feely. Long hugs and stroking my face/back. He also seems to want to spoil me. He gave me money randomly ($35) and took me out to buy shirts and shorts. The problem is that the rent is extremely cheap and he helps me with rides to work and anything that I’m in need of. I’m scared that putting him in his place would ruin the step forward I have made in life.

Update: He’s handing me cash left and right and the hugs have increased in tenderness. He’s hinted toward a “mutual” relationship, I.e. if I help in one way he’ll help in another. Honestly idfk at this point. Also after mentioning that I should always be able to pay rent on time, he quickly responded with “Well... in one way or another.”
I went to my room for the night shortly after.

Update: I’m cutting off the affection and the generous offers as well. I’m remaining a tennant and nothing more and I’m positive he’s okay with that. Nothing but mutual respect for each other still remains. Thank you all for your support through this. It was definitely a first for me and a big mental struggle to work through! You all really helped me."

Is it too much? We've only recently become good friends and so this is my first time getting her a present.

I wanted to get her something nice, but not too expensive so I went with a build-a-bear that has loads of personal jokes and stuff she likes attached.

I don't know if I'm just overthinking things but the more I think about it the more I think maybe could it be too much? Like could things become really awkward between us if she doesn't like me back and takes this as a sign of me liking her.

Really unsure, what do you guys think?

Edit: Wow I did not expect this kind of a response haha. Just wanted to clear a few things up:

The teddy was and is not meant to be some sort of romantic gesture towards her, my worry was how she would perceive it and whether or not it would make her feel put on the spot, cause that's obviously the last thing i want.

The teddy itself is in no way decorated as a romantic gift, there's no hearts or ""I love you"" message stored inside, it is actually quite a joking manner about it pointing to some inside jokes while also having the idea of a nice present.

We've only become good friends since around September-ish, however we have known each other for a good few years now just not at the level that we do now. I've only really ""liked"" her since the turn of the year. I have also had some signs that lead me to believe she might actually like me back as well.

Genuinely appreciate everyone who replied, means a lot. I in no way expected this to blow up in the way it did. Guess I'll have to update on how it goes now."

Hey y’all, I go to a community college and a kid in my class has said some things to me that have been somewhat alarming. Let me start off by saying that there is something definitely wrong with this guy mentally. He makes weird jokes in class and does not know when to stop annoying classmates and is overall rude to everyone around him. 

Anyway, the first week of class a couple of students have to go to the bookstore to get the book for the class including myself and this guy. He for some reason latches on to me like a magnet and just starts talking at me. He goes on about random subjects and then he starts talking about teachers. He told me how some teacher spit in his face five times “unprovoked” and that he was going to try and get this teacher fired. I didn’t really believe him nor did I care if it was true or not because in my mind I just wanted this guy to stop talking to me. After telling me this story he kept on asking me to not tell anyone in a tone that was almost threatening. I wanted to confront him on this but I decided against it.

Fast forward to this morning when the real concern about this guy arose. In our class we match up in pairs to do classwork and somebody has to work with the guy. The girl that had to work with him worked with him begrudgingly. She ended up working by herself and left the guy to finish his work on his own. Nothing happened in class, but what he said to me after class has me worried.

He starts off with telling me not to tell anyone about what he is about to say. He says the girl that worked with him was a bitch and that if she was a guy he would have hit her, because he does not hit women (his words not mine). He later said that he did not know what he would do if this girl would do this to him again. Now if you are like me, when someone tells me that they don’t know what they are going to do in terms of anger or just whatever this guy is thinking, I think he is going to hurt this girl or others. 

Now my question is if I should report this ASAP or should I just wait and let this go to see if he says anything else that is alarming in the future. Thanks for the advice in advance."

At the show I got really drunk and was stuck on the bathroom floor because I couldn't walk and afterwards it took two of my friends to help me walk back to the hotel. I laid down on the bed (that I was supposed to share with a female friend) and the rest of my group were chatting and drinking on the other bed. After a little while my best friend and the guy she was hooking up with got into a fight because she had made out with his best friend. So he decided to climb into bed with me, in front of everyone, and started to do things to me. I couldn't consent, I couldn't even get a noise out of my mouth because I was so sick and drunk. Instead of helping me they all left the room and left me with him. The worst part is my friend was mad at me the next morning and blamed me for what he did.
I had buried this down for a long time and tried not to think about it but I recently told someone what happened and I just can't stop reliving it. Can anyone help? 

Edit: She just started dating the guy a couple weeks ago and she dropped me as a friend two months ago. We had been friends for 10 years

Edit 2: I'm adding this for clarification because a lot of people have been asking how I remember all of this. I remember everything up toseeing the second act, after that it's patchy. I do remember the end of the night though. The next day I was shown videos that they had taken of me when I on the bathroom floor captioned as ""shes druuuuuunnnk""."

I don't know how to get over it or forgive him First time posting here so sorry for any mistakes. The past couple of days have been a whirlwind and right now I'm really questioning everything and if I should even continue my relationship. My mom abandoned me with my dad when I was 3. She just up and left one night, never to give a crap about me again. My dad didn't know how to raise a little girl but he did his best. He drank a lot and smoked a lot but he never hit me or was abusive to me. He supported me no matter what I wanted to do and did his best to be a good father. I met my now boyfriend 2 years ago through mutual friends at a party. We hit it off instantly. 3 months into our relationship, he revealed me to he had a kid and it would be a dealbreaker if I couldn't handle that. I basically became a stepmom at 18 and didn;t mind it. He wanted me to move in with him and he would 'take care of me' and I was really dumb enough to believe it. My dad never said otherwise, he just supported me and even went as far as helping me pay to move to rhode island to be with my boyfriend and his kid.

On Monday I got the call that my dad passed away. He was only 45. His girlfriend hadn't heard from him in a couple of days and went to check on him and she found him in his bed. She thinks it was a heart attack or aneurysm but it's still not 100 percent confirmed. She was the one who called me to tell me about him being gone. I feel so guilty because he called me on Sunday night and I didn't answer. I didn't get one last chance to talk to my dad.

My boyfriend didn't even try to comfort me or anything when I told him. He was busy playing a video game and I asked him to please stop because I was trying not to have a breakdown. His response to my dad's passing was ""Well all that drinking and smoking finally caught up with him huh?"" I asked him what the fuck was his problem, my dad just died. I needed his support and needed him to go home with me and help me plan my dad's funeral because I had no idea what I was doing. He told me under no circumstances can I go home and help my dad's girlfriend plan his funeral. I can't leave him with his kid for the weekend alone, he says. He literally said ""You're not allowed to go unless I say so"" which just enraged me. I asked him what his problem was and his answer was ""I never liked your dad and I don't want you going to his funeral. I need you here to help me take care of my kid when I'm at work. You're not going, end of story""

I've been seeing red ever since. I have sacrificed so much for him. I'm up to my eyeballs in debt for him. I've co-signed loans for him to help him build his credit and I've literally paid his child support for him before when he's been short. He's the one who convinced me to leave my job and go back to school full time and pretty much take care of his son for him when it's his weekends. There have been so many chances when I could have gone to see my dad before he passed and my boyfriend has always said ""next time"" and now there is no next time. He acts like he owns me and I just don't know if I can continue to be with him after this. He has been so cold and downright cruel

I am going to pawn my laptop and probably some jewelry and figure out how the fuck to get away from him. I've spoken to my dad's girlfriend and she's told me if I leave him, I have a place to stay with her and she's willing to help me get back on my feet. I feel so defeated and angry. I want to call my dad and talk to him and I can't even do that. I just want to go home and say goodbye to my dad. I just want to go cold shoulder and leave and say ""fuck you and fuck your kid"" but is that going to far? I know I don't want to be with him any longer after this. I don't know what's the right thing to do. I'm just so angry

tl;dr: My dad passed away. Boyfriend has been majorly unsupportive. Angry and just want to burn the relationship to the ground. So angry I don't know if I'm thinking straight"

He proposed then decided it was more important to take care of his mom. It’s like a Norman Bates thing. He’s 44 and never lived alone. So do I toss 8 years?

Edit. I’ve been to his house many times because she’s been in the hospital. I’ve asked to meet her thousands of times and he says I promise and never allows it. He says it’s too much for her and he doesn’t want her to know his business. She’s too controlling. Also she would be upset because she’s afraid to lose her care taker. I’ve offered to help and he says it’s too much for her to meet someone. She’s too mentally clouded. It’s been just him and her since she divorced his father at 8.

I also want to say I’ve met everyone in his family in his dads side. His mom has no family. He has 2 step brothers and one half brother from his dad and they invite me everywhere. His sister in law loves me. And they have never met his mom either.

So I left. He said he didn’t like ultimatums and it’s definitely my fault. That sucked but ya know. Life."

Edit 2 : I sat down with my parents today, they took it really well and were very supportive and constructive. I certainly was overthinking their potential reactions and got overwhelmed. I'm booking an mri tomorrow, hopefully everything comes back fine so that I can rule out the surgery being a problem.
Thanks again to everyone for their advice and supportive comments
------

I was born with a conditional called craniosynostosis, which means my skull had difficulty growing properly. Details can be found here: 

http://www.columbianeurology.org/neurology/staywell/document.php?id=36854

Untreated, this can lead to serious brain development problems and pressure on the brain.

The surgery used to 'correct' this was fronto orbital advancement, which involved titanium plates being screwed into my skull from the inside to assist skull growth. Apart from being bullied about the scars that run from one ear to the other, I never payed much more attention to the outcome of the surgery. I always put it off as nothing at the time, but I got crazy headaches all throughout my childhood.

Now that I am 19, I'm becoming more critical of myself and what I feel. I haven't really stopped getting headaches, I just have constantly put it down to stress or not enough water. I went skydiving at 16 it felt like my skull was literally splitting. Occasionally on planes my head will have a similar but not as intense splitting pain. My head is alsomuch noticeably smaller than everyone around me, and there are dents along the scarline of where the surgery joined my skull. In particularly one section intrudes a fair bit, this is also the spot that hur most regularly.  My memory is absolutely shocking to the point I'm forgetting that my phone is in my lap before standing up. I'm finding myself repeating the same things to people, and having to rewind parts of movies because I can't recall half their character's conversation.



I went to the doctors with these concerns yesterday who suggested I get a blood test and go from there, but I just want someone to tell me something productive. I really don't know if I should tell my parents and raise concerns before I know anything for certain, and if I should bring up why they didn't tell me about contact sports."

**UPDATE**: Everyone's been asking me for an update. I will give you one but you will probably be disappointed. 

Nothing happened. At all. I practiced speeches, conversations, prepared, and nothing happened. 

Our school isn't so big and doesn't have many ""big"" issues like this so I doubt she would forget me. 

Since I'm paranoid and she thinks she's so powerful, I think she did it on purpose. 
Maybe she thought ""if this kid has the photo, he'll probably delete and bring the phone in tomorrow. Then the photo will be gone for good"". Maybe she expected me to not bring my phone and is waiting for me to slip up and say/do something. 

But that's all speculation. The only fact is that today nothing happened. I even looked her in the eye walking past. She didn't do anything. 

Whatever it is I'll still keep my phone at school and stay quiet about the situation.

I didn’t really know where to post this, so I came here. I babysit for a family with two kids — a 4 year old boy and a 6 year old girl. The 4 year old boy is a saint, but the girl never listens to me or her parents. Anyway, the first day I started the mom had me bathe them and I’ve been bathing them everyday ever since. They do not have sugar coated words for their body parts. They call it penis and vagina, and also sometimes privates. I thought it was a bit weird that they don’t sugar coat it, but I’ve heard that it’s better to tell them the names straight up, but I don’t know. When I bathe them, I clean everywhere, but their privates and then ask them to do their privates themselves. A lot of times they both say “no I want you to do it” and then when I do it they tell me it tickles. The girl acts strange sometimes. She tries to show her brother and I her privates. The other day she peed in the bathtub as soon as she got in it and I told the mother and the mother said she’s never done that before. She also once told me that her doctor told her that it’s okay for babysitters to touch her vagina. What I’m most concerned about is that last week when I was bathing the girl she started talking about her vagina and then inserted a finger into it. I immediately told her not to do that. I asked some friends and family members if they thought this was weird behavior for a 6 year old and that I should tell the mother. I really don’t know what to do. I don’t want the mother to think I’m like sexualizing it or become offended that I think it’s odd behavior. I also don’t want all these things to come back and bite me in the ass since I’m the one who bathes her. Can someone give me some guidance here?

Edit: thank you for all the responses. I am going to start answering each right now, but might take me some time to get to all

Edit 2: I forgot to mention that the mom is at the home about 80% of the time while I’m giving baths. Why she can’t do it herself? I don’t know. But she is around while I’m doing it."

So I then went into the hall and started talking to my brother and we were both like wtf is going on, and just to add fire to the flames, a man likely acquainted with the gunshots outside the house starts yelling in a scary loud panicking voice, and that alone scared the absolute shit out of me and my little brother. The yelling happened a solid 20-30 seconds after the last gunshots we heard, but then a bit after, the same yelling man started banging the shit out of our front door as if he wanted to break in by force, the doorbell was being spammed as well and his terrifying aggressive yells did not help in a situation like that.

At that point me and my brother feared for our lives so we ran into the restroom and started looking for my dad's pistol in the room (the restroom and bedroom are connected) keep in mind we are alone at home at the time bcz my dad was picking my mom up from work.

I called the cops while keeping my voice from sounding how I actually felt, panic, and gave them all the details of wtf was going on and how me and my brother were scared of this possible drug head banging on the door and the possibility of him having a gun.

My parents who were hella farther from the nearest police station arrive before any cop does, and that was 30 min after the call, and that is because here I am at almost 1am with no cop ever arriving... all I am saying is that if something happened to me and my brother the police would not have been there to help... and that honestly scares the shit out of me because I don't know what to do... 

Should I report this??? And if so to who??? Thank u for reading if u made it this far, I need advice on this... 

I'm also new to this neighborhood as we moved into our first ever house about a month ago, I've never experienced anything like this and the feelings that go along with it is horrible.

I suffer from PTSD, I'm afraid to be alone and I can't even be touched and this has been possibly the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. I've been working with a detective; I gave them everything I had on this person, they have the kit the hospital took, every message sent between us, the person's phone number, etc. And he was taken into custody. 

Fast forward to today, I get a random message on Facebook which is odd because it's from a person I don't know. To make it even weirder it was a completely blank profile, no friends, no nothing. This person started out by saying ""hey, have you ever met with a person at blah blah blah"" and essentially, the person who messaged me was my rapist posing as his mother.  I found it threatening because they said things like, ""you know he has a video"" which yes I do, and so do the police, and also saying things like ""they'll never believe you"" which I know is an intimidation tactic because I'm not the only person who came forward about him (there are four other women). 

My problem is that I don't like the fact that my rapist is able to find me. I've completely deleted 100% of social media now because of this and I am terrified of what is going to happen to me. I'm an anxious mess, and I am so utterly nervous over everything that could potentially happen. What if he uploads the videos? What if he hunts me down again? What the heck do I do? I've already sent the full conversation to the detective and they said it's being handled but that isn't helping me calm down. I'm completely distraught. Who does this?? 

I'm just looking for advice on how to cope with all of this because honestly I'm losing my mind and all I want to do is lock myself in my room and cuddle my cat and cry but I know I can't. I have to work and go to school and keep going but everything in me doesn't want to."

About a month ago I got a call from my parents saying my sister had committed suicide. She had been struggling with mental health and over the past year or so developed severe schizophrenia. She got to the point where she believed there were cameras and microphones implanted in her and she believed she was pregnant but she wasn't. She had tried (unsuccessfully) in the past to kill herself by swallowing all her medication but because it was only anti-psychotics she lived. 

She was found at her friends house where she had been staying. In her room they found multiple suicide notes written that same week detailing some of her schizophrenic delusions and how she was going to kill herself, leaving details for funeral plans etc. With that information, it seemed clear that she had overdosed on something as she was found passed out on the floor having coughed up blood. 

I have spent the past couple weeks dealing with her death as a suicide, but today we got a call from the medical examiner saying her actual cause of death was Pneumonia. I just got off the phone and do not have any idea how to feel about this whatsoever. Am I supposed to be happy she didn't kill herself or sad because she died from something preventable or I don't even know. She was only 22. Any comments or advice would help.

Our conversations also revolve quite a lot about sex related topics, and often about her boobs.

A few months ago we were shopping and I was in the fitting room next to her and she suddenly whispers me to come in her so I do, and she is wearing a top that is so low cut that it shows more of her boobs/bra than the shirt.
A few weeks before that she suddenly sends me a snapchat of only her boobs in a bikini to ask me if the bikini is nice.

Now just a few minutes ago she has a new skirt which has a zipper which can be open almost all the way up, which she had done and send a snapchat to me with almost her entire underwear showing.

She confirmed several times over the past few weeks that I am her best friend, or says stuff like ""yeah people are asking why we aren't dating and I'm like well i dont know haha""

Hi, I'm incredibly new to reddit. Something happened today and I need help. 
I am at a complete loss for what to do next, I don't even know how to begin to explain how I'm feeling and what happened.
I suppose I will start off by saying that a giant chunk of my childhood is murky at best. I have very few memories from about 7-13.
Today my step father called me and asked me if I remember him molesting me. At first I was shocked and I asked him why he was saying this, what happened, why why why.
I started frantically trying to remember, I simply can't. There is nothing.
I turned the question on him and he said he exposed himself to me a lot... 
I asked if he had any other victims and he said his previous step daughter. 
He said he is going crazy and wants to turn himself. 
He asked me what I would do if someone molested my son, would I kill them, would I want them in prison? 
I had to hang up. 
I've always felt repulsed by him in a sense, maybe a more gentle word... Aversion? 
My teen years he and my mother sent me all over to live, my aunts, my grandmothers, job corps. I have always felt discarded but I assumed it was because they had their two boys (my half brothers). I was a mouthy teen but I didn't have sex or do drugs or anything like that. Maybe they sent me away so I wouldn't say anything? 
My brother,his wife and my niece live with my parents. 
I called my brother and told him what had happened and begged him to talk to my niece and make sure he isn't hurting her. 
What do I do now. How do I process this? Is there an option to move on without trying to pry those memories from my subconscious? 
I am a mess, I always know the answers and I don't know what to do. 
The situation is so complicated, my relationship with my family is complicated. 
I am happy to answer clarifying questions, I just desperately need advice. 
Thank you for listening.

update edit: 

Hey guys, thanks for all the replies on this thread. 
I have decided to let this slide as he is not talking to me at this moment and decided to not talk to him unless about work stuff. 

For the ones who said it's not okay to call out names/insult  him, I am not feeling guilty since it was one to one conversation and if he didn't get my point I can't help him. 

Escalating to HR will be harsh. I am not trying to make him the bad guy. I hope he understand that I wasn't insulting him and reflect on his behaviour towards others."

They invited him for dinner
My parents told me and they saw the look on my face, to this day i wont tell them what i did it was shameful and i feel like my mum wont be the same about what she thinks of child me.

He came for dinner but mum let me stay the night at my boyfriends and they had a wonderful time

I know in the future theyre going to meet each other again for coffee etc but when ever i think about it it stresses me out so much, hes an actual predator and my parents think hes a ray of sunshine.

Do i tell my mother what i did if she forces me to see him again? Or do i just refuse it again and stick out seeing him
Im only 17

Thank you everyone for your wonderful comments i took in everything everyone said and i did tell my mum, im unsure of her next move but believes me and she is respectful that it wasnt my fault and he was in the wrong, i didnt think she would so this has helped me so much, i wish i could give you all presents this helped so much.

Now that I'm quarantined, I feel loneliner than ever. I'd like to beging by acknowledging all the people out there right now who have horrid circumstances that are potentially life-threatening. I fully recognize how insignificant my problems are by comparison. I still feel the need to vent so here is me doing so.

I'm 21 and I still feel like I haven't met anyone who I've formed a genuine romantic connection with. I'm not wishing for a fairytale love story. I just see so many people in my life with their *person* and it's hard feeling like I've never had that.

I've had one girlfriend who I didn't really like tgat much. Then, before this pandemic began, I met a perfect woman on Tinder, but everything went south when I crossed her boundaries and didn't give her any space. In the first case, I wasn't that interested in my partner, and I was with her so that I wouldn't be alone; obviously it ended in disaster. In the second case, I was too attached to the *idea* of a person that I couldn't pay attention to the woman in front of me. That also ended inn disaster.

All that said, I think I've reached a point of maturity now where I'm ready to look for someone to form a healthy relationship with. But now the world is on pause, and I have to wait. And I have to learn to be okay with being alone.

Ironically, I'm super introverted, and need to be alone most of the time. But introverts still have social lives and I feel like I've always lacked that. Perhaps I just need more friends to talk to consistently, but even then, I can't go out to meet anyone now.

What can I work on while we're in this mess so that I can come out if it a healthier individual?"

Hi, first post and I'm on mobile.

Hi all, I've recently started a 3 month brick laying job trial and my mum has decided that I have to start paying rent. My current girlfriend (18) and her parents have offered to let me move in for $100 a week, which includes food, water, electricity and I'm looking for advice on whether I should take this up or not. 

To clarify I don't particularly like my home life, and I know it sounds like I'm stuck up and ungrateful but it just seems like I may aswel live somewhere I would actually enjoy to live rather then my house if I'm paying to live there.

Sorry if this is a mess, I was never too good at English. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Have a really lovely day/night.

Edit: To clarify I am from Australia, Im working upwards of 65 hours a week, my mum is charging me 160 a week. I know it doesn't seem like some but it is a lot for me. My brother is 18, still lives at home and doesn't pay anything. I am constantly berated, laughed at or forced to do chores all day (which I get, you live in the house so clean it). I really don't like it in the house and consider myself an outsider in the family.

I'm working 7 days a week, as I've got to pay for transport, food, clothes and now rent and I'm unsure how I'd afford all of this without working both jobs.

Edit 2: Thankyou everyone for commenting your advice, the main reason I asked this was because I'm scared that I'm growing up to fast, and that I'm going to be overwhelmed in stress. Thankyou for giving your honest opinions, and sorry for the lack of Information. This blew up way more then I thought it would. Thankyou.

My husband and I have been together for about 14 years. No kids, 3 dogs. He's worked at the same retail chain store for almost 20 years. He's turning 39 in about a month. He's been complaining about heel/foot pain that we thought was due to psoriatic arthritis (he got a blood test done and whatever inflammation level was within the normal range so it's not that) but now he thinks it might be planter fasciitis. He's been wearing compression socks to sleep and stretching and icing but it's still hurting him.

He's just started a 3 month stretch of graveyards at work. Last night was his first night and he's terrible at sleeping. We have an older dog with a degenerative disease that is taking a lot of energy and time that we're going to have to put to sleep soon.

So today he slept until about 5pm after coming home at 7am. I took care of the dogs and did a few chores since I had the day off today. We went to Costco, bought some stuff, all in all a pretty normal day. 

He went to go take a shower. I was playing some switch game when he gets out of the shower, gets dressed and comes downstairs to make his lunch. I wander over to see what's going in and see that he grabbed an applesauce. I joked and said something along the lines of ""hey that's my applesauce"" so he looks at me and throws it back in the fridge. I tell him I'm joking but he just goes to grab some chips. So me being me I then say ""oh those are my chips too"" so he pretends to put them back.

He then looks at me and bursts into tears (I can count on my hands how many times I've seen him cry) and says he's so fucking miserable. I immediately get super concerned because until this point I thought we were just playing around. I ask what's wrong and he says that he's miserable and so tired. I'm crying at this point and I ask what in particular is making him miserable. I tell him to call into work tonight but he says he can't because there's too much work to do. I ask if it's just work and he said it's everything. He said it's the house (it's not disgusting but it's not super clean either and we have been talking about selling after Zoey gets put to sleep), his job and he's just tired. 

He cried for a little then pulled himself together and gave me a hug and started putting the rest of his lunch together. I reiterated that he should stay home or fucking quit if it will make him happy but he said no. 

I don't know what to do. I want him to be happy. I don't know if it's the foot pain, the hating of his job, the fact that we have to put our dog down soon, the fact that he doesn't sleep well and is always tired or if it's something else (depression?) but I don't know how to help him or what to do to make him happy. Has anyone else been in this situation and how did you handle it? 
 
We didn't have time for an in-depth talk since he went to work right after but towards the end of the conversation we were both joking around a little. I'm scared and I don't know how to handle this.  What should I do to help him?



Edit: 

Sorry about the slow response. I thought I was just yelling into the void. I really, really appreciate all you lovely humans for trying to help me and taking time out of your day to give an internet stranger some advice. 

So I talked to my husband after he got up today. According to him, a lot of things are stressing him out right now but mostly the graveyard hours (he said he feels like all he does is sleep then go to work) and our dog who is very needy right now.  

What we're going to do:

We set a firm date for Zoey's (our dog) appointment. It's a hard thing to do but we think she's ready.

A lot of you mentioned burn out and taking a vacation (or staycation) and we already have a vacation planned for his birthday so I'm going to plan a really fun trip. 

I reiterated that he can quit anytime he wants, He recently applied for a position at USPS so maybe that will come to something?  Some wise person in the comments section said something to the effect of ""he can't do that job for another 20 years"" and I completely agree but I never thought about it that way.  When it's phrased like that it makes much more of an impact. 

The graveyards are going through the summer so unless he quits he will be on that schedule for 3 months.  We just put up black out curtains and got some ear plugs for him so hopefully that will help with the sleeping. 

I'm making him another appointment with the foot specialist he saw earlier this year. The specialist gave him some nicer (but not custom) insoles and a cortisone shot.  He's been doing all the things that the specialist told him to do and if the pain is still disrupting his life to this extent he needs to be seen again. Sometimes you have to be the squeaky wheel to get the treatment you need. 

We're making a fun chore chart to help us both keep on track with household chores and I'm looking into getting a service to come in once a week so that's exciting!

Again, thank you all for your suggestions and advice. Y'all really came through for me. I hope I can return the favor sometime. 

Internet hugs,
sorryimleaving"

My father is a pedophile and no one but me knows it. Obligatory I wrote this on mobile, throwaway account etc. 
My sibling is expecting a baby girl this summer. I have been going over this possibility for a long time, if they have a girl what the fuck am I going to do.
Our dad molested me for years when i was a small child. My sibling doesn't know. It would kill them because they love our dad so much. My sibling had a very different childhood than I did and also doesn't handle stress well.
I told my mother when i was about 4 years old and she didn't protect or believe me. Even though my dad was already on the sex offender registry for previous crimes before they met. So she technically knows but she's equally a piece of shit human for this and many other reasons.
I'm at a loss here, how do I tell? Should i tell? It's been over 20 years. I'm afraid that all that will happen is that I'll be told to fuck off, that I'm lying and my sibling will just exclude me from my niece's life all together and I won't be able to help keep her safe.
I could tell my sibling's partner or ask my favorite aunt to help. I just don't know.
When i first found out I did say 'mom and dad aren't allowed to babysit ever, for any reason' and they agreed with that opinion.
The whole purpose of my worry is this little girl. The rest of the world could burn down for all I care.
So, Reddit, has anyone been here? Does anyone have any advice?


Edit: I want to say thanks to everyone of you beautiful strangers for your advice and your stories. It doesn't matter how old you get or how ok you think you are now, hearing that you aren't alone is so helpful when you are scared.
A clarification, it is my brother that is having a little girl.
And i was upset and mid panic attack when i posted this, I never meant to make it sound like i was unsure about speaking up or not. There is no way in fuck that anyone could keep me quiet about this.
Thank you for all of the love and encouragement. I'm going to find a day that he and his girlfriend are home so I can go see them."

Sorry if this isn’t the right place to post this . Last friday we had a snow storm and one of my co workers who lives out in the boonies called saying she would be late for work, but she never showed up at all . Our manager wasn’t in so we assumed she just got off the whole day and our manger never relayed the message. The next couple of days she didn’t show up or call at all . At this point our manger , and everyone was starting to get concerned. Almost everyone texted her to ask if she was okay , and no one got a response and her phone goes straight to voice mail. 

It is the kind of job that has high turn over and people do quit by not showing up pretty often , so normally this wouldn’t alarm me . This girl is not like that though , she is very responsible and she also called saying she was on her way that Friday . Usually when people quit , they wouldn’t call saying they are on their way . Another thing that alarms me is her boyfriend is definitely mental abusive and we all suspect physically abusive. We have witnessed him berate her and make her cry almost daily . She has come in with bruises and scratches a couple times and when you ask what happens she gives everyone a different answer and changes the subject as fast a possible . 
We are all worried some thing bad happened to her. 

It’s been a whole week and no one has been able to get a hold of her. We even contacted her best friend who said she hasn’t heard from her in over two weeks. 

Do you think someone should report her missing ? Maybe she just wanted to quit and doesn’t want to talk to people at the job because she is a really anxious person. 

UPDATE : Hey guys just an update , 
Police told me she was safe ! Not sure what’s going on , I didn’t ask ! But she is safe ! Thanks for the help everyone "

How can I get my mom to realize it's not helping and to stop this madness? My parents divorced when I got into college, it was a very harsh divorce, with police involved a lot of times and everything you can imagine, my younger sister lived with my parents at the time and suffered so much trauma through it that at around 18-20 she developed schizophrenia, she has had plenty manic and delusional episodes and has been in and out of the mental ward for about 5 years.

My father left home after the divorce and she lives only with my grandma and mother now, the problem is my grandmother is very religious and my mother has always been a very nervous / anxious person, my teenage memories is my mother always screaming around with me or my sister, it was always kind of a mess. With my sister mental issue my mother hasn't been able to deal with it, she is not helping at all with the way she is handling it. 

I've realized my mother is now spending hundreds if not thousands of   dollars on amulets, tarot, witches, acupuncture, reiki masters and a shitload of other snake oils and bullshit, to the point where even my sister told me privately when I went to visit for Christmas she has had enough, at first she liked the rocks and amulets and found them pretty and even lucky, now she is starting to become disgusted at all the shit my mom is forcing her to go through.  

It got so bad my sister is taking anticoagulants for a blood problem and my mother forced her to go through a few acupuncture sessions which is very risky as someone on that kind of medication as she can bleed out.

She also offered to a old lady for my sister to work for free for her in exchange for the lady to offer her tarot and ""pray"" services. My sister refused to do that.

What can I do to get my mother to see that she is handling things the wrong way and what she is doing is not helping at all with my sister mental issue? I don't live with them, and I study and work so it's very hard for me to help my sister and be there for her."

So back in October my boyfriend of 5 years and I took a break. I knew he was hanging out with other girls so I felt I should do the same. I downloaded bumble and matched with someone that I hit it off with right away. We had so many similar interests and what seemed like great conversation. 

We texted a bunch that first day we matched and covered topics like childhood, religion, past relationships, etc. that normally you wouldn’t discuss instantly. I guess in the back of my head I thought it was a little much but it also was cool to talk with someone that I had so much in common with. 

We planned a time to hangout and he lived in a town about 45 min away so he asked if he could pick me up instead of meeting somewhere unfamiliar to him. Let me say that I know this was not smart of me. You should always meet up in a public place first and not at your own home or theirs. I don’t know why I agreed but I did. 

He picked me up and right when I opened the door my stomach knotted up. This was not the guy in the pictures online. I mean, it was, but the pictures were obviously very old and he looked nothing like them anymore. I felt uncomfortable right away and didn’t know what to do. 

We got in his car and went to a bar. The whole time I was just trying to think of an excuse to get out of this whole thing. I texted my friends and asked what to do but no one was replying. I felt nervous like I couldn’t just straight up say “what the f, you catfished me take me home.” 

We got a drink and sat down and the conversation sucked. Nothing like the convos we had through text. It was like someone else had been texting for him. I rushed through my drink and after about 30 minutes was more than ready to leave. 

He asked if I wanted another drink and I said no. He asked if I wanted to get food, again I said no and that I was ready to go home. 

He took me home and I pretty much rushed out of the car and into my house. About 30 seconds after being inside I got a text from him. “I feel like you didn’t like me and I don’t know why,” it said. Um maybe I didn’t like you bc you tricked me into thinking you were someone you weren’t? I didn’t say that. I didn’t reply. More texts came. And then more. And I felt like I had to say something to get him to stop. I said “I don’t think we had any chemistry, conversation was better through text and that’s a turnoff, sorry this just won’t ever be anything.” I thought that would do it and that’d be the end of it, after all, he was almost 10 years older than me, he should be mature, right?

Nope. More texts came. Long ones. Ones begging me to take a trip with him that weekend. (What?! Sorry who does that after meeting ONCE). 

I blocked his number. He followed me on Instagram and messaged me a long message again. I blocked him there as well. 

Thinking I had covered my bases of social media I relaxed. About a month or so went by, my boyfriend and I were seeing each other again, I wasn’t worried. 

Then one day I got a LONG message from an Instagram account that had random letters as the username, no pictures, no followers or anything. It was him. I screenshot it and blocked the account. 

Again, thought that was the end of it because I’m naive. A couple months go by and now we’re at last night (feb 20th). I woke up at about 1 and saw notifications on my phone from the app VSCO. I’ve had one since 2013. It’s where I dump all my pictures I don’t want to put on main social media where people can look at them all the time. He had made an account under the same name as the Instagram. On that account were just photos of me. Nothing else. Just reposts of my pictures, specifically pictures I took of myself. 

I blocked him but VSCO says that you can only block them from interacting with you and that they can still see your profile. 

I don’t know what to do. He knows where I live and he seems to try every avenue to get contact. It’s just making me uncomfortable and anxious because I don’t know him or what he’s capable of. Am I overreacting? Should I just brush it off and not be nervous if it keeps happening? What do I do? 

TL;DR: guy I went on one 45 min date with 4 months ago keeps making fake social media accounts to contact me and I keep blocking them, he knows where I live and it’s making me uncomfortable. "

My housemate who I share a wall with always has really loud sex. I am 24F and he is 30M. We slept together when I first moved into the flat 10 months ago but we haven't slept together for 7 months now (I have learnt the hard way to not shit where I eat!). 

He sleeps with a lot of different women and has loud sex about 3/4 times per week. I am usually out of the flat a lot and it hasn't bothered me too much in the past, however I've been feeling a bit low/lonely recently because of Coronavirus and also my mum was involved in a car accident and has been quite badly affected. Me and the guy are quite good friends and I've told him about my mum. 

I have been staying at my mum's most nights this week to help care for her, however when I have stayed at the flat he has started having loud sex within 5 mins of me entering my room on two occasions. I can't help but feel like he is doing it on purpose to get a reaction out of me.

He has told me before that he knows he has really loud sex. I didn't say anything at the time because it didn't used to bother me much and usually I can block it out with earplugs. However, it was so loud this week that I could hear it even while wearing earplugs. I thought maybe our walls were just thin but the flatmate I share a wall with said he has never heard me having sex.

I don't know whether I should ask him to be quieter or whether I should try and ignore it because that is the reaction he is looking for?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your hilarious suggestions and insightful advice. In the end I decided to message him asking if he could please be more mindful of noise levels when he has women over. He apologised and said he didn't realise I was home last night.

I realised that I do still have feelings for him and decided I need to take responsibility for my own happiness and move out. I have requested to end my tenancy at the end of the month. The flatmate told me he will be sad to see me go and we had an amicable meeting where we both apologised but agreed it was probably for the best.

Thanks Reddit community!

I would rather he get in trouble and her caught than him not in trouble and her not being caught. If getting her caught for this sh*t means he hates me, so be it. If she does get caught, I will talk to him about never doing it. 


TL;DR, if he reports her, is there any way to do it so that it doesn’t go back to him as a victim?



EDIT AND UPDATE:


A lot happened last night between the 2 comments I had and this morning. The boy called the police, and told his parents. He also informed me that I misunderstood. The woman, who he says barely spoke English, convinced him to FaceTime and strip down. She recorded him naked without his consent and he was unaware there would be any record of the encounter. She messaged him shortly after claiming she would send the images to his friends and family on Facebook, whom she had already sent friend requests to. He had showed me the account and it was clearly a throwaway, complete with “employee at the Krusty Krab” as occupation. 

Edit#2: fixed a typo at the beginning of the post where my autocorrect changed “is” to “isn’t”, leading several people to think I was a troll."

This is quite and embarrassing situation and I'm honestly humiliated writing this.

I am a 32M powerlifter and I occasionally get massages because my muscles hurt.

While walking home from work the other day I was handed a business brochure/card/ad for a new massage spa that had opened up close by. On Friday, I decided to stop by and try the place out.

**I thought the price was a little steep, at least compared to previous places I was used to.**

**Edit: I have now realized what a fucking dumbass idiot jerk man I am. I'm so sorry I ever even considered getting this innocent woman in trouble with either her employers (if she is not trafficked) and fired, or getting her in trouble with the people holding her captive (if she is being trafficked) or both parties with the police. My stupid train of thought that could only arise from being the clueless privileged white guy that I am was to think I was the victim in all of this. When really, (a) I'm not because I could have done my homework on the place, I could have communicated better, I should have not been so naive; (b) she is most likely an undocumented immigrant and involving the authorities could cause her to deported and no longer able to feed or see her family; (c) I could be fighting harder for sex worker's rights - I said that I support them but without action on my part, I'm just paying lip service. I promise to do more to fight for women's rights and sex worker's rights and immigrant's rights. I'm so sorry for being such a piece of shit. I hope everyone can forgive me. This has been a learning experience that I will never forget about my disgusting misuse and show of my privilege as a white guy.**

I was introduced to the women who was going to be giving the massage. She looked mid thirties, didn't speak much English except for a Thai accent.

She asked what kind of massage I wanted and I told her that my muscles hurt from lifting weights and training and that I want to relax and I trust she will take care of me.

I have been harping on myself and dwelling and wondering if anything I said was a codeword for soliciting sex because of what happened next.

After about five minutes of a decent (not terrible but not amazing) back massage, she asked me to flip over and started massaging my legs. She was getting dangerously close to my private area and then next thing I know she was touching my genitals. I admit that I froze up in shock at what was going on.

After 10 seconds of her ""massaging"" that area, I came to my senses and asked her to stop. She then got very nervous and apologized and said she thought I wanted ""massage"" (while winking) and I said yes I want a massage but not ""that kind"" of massage. She apologized profusely and offered to ""fix up"", but I just said no thanks and walked out. I paid my bill and left. The front desk seemed confused because it was only maybe 10 minutes total that I was in the room for and I paid for a one hour massage, but I did not make a big deal.

After thinking about this nonstop all weekend, I am deciding to ask for advice on what I should do. I don't want to get her fired because I do support sex workers, but only when their customers know and consent to the services they are receiving. Should I complain to the spa in general? Or what if they are owned by gang members and it is just a front for prostitution? But if they are not a brothel, then what are they?

Should I say anything at all or just keep my mouth shut? I don't want to leave a nasty Yelp review because if they are organized crime then they will know it is me and they will come after me.

Please has anyone else had something similar happen to them and what did you do about it?"

What now? So my girlfriend and I go into a fight where she said ""You love those fucking fish more than me"" this started because I just bought a new fish that cost $5000 and I wouldn't buy her a new dress because I couldn't afford it. I saved up for many years to buy this fish and she knew that but she was still angry that I spent money on a fish and not on her. The fight escalated when I walked in on her pouring bleach into his tank I screamed at her to stop but she just looked at me and smiled so I ran up to her and with my hand forcefully pushed her arm away from the tank and she slammed to the ground. She looked up at me shocked and said ""You just hit me"" she left the house crying and I have not seen her for 2 days. I immediately took the fish out of the tank and changed all of the water but he is acting lethargic, I hope me makes a full recovery.

TLDR; I threw my girlfriend to the ground for pouring bleach into my tank and she ran off what do I do?

*Edit 
He is an Asian arowana 
he has eaten and is swimming around a bit now, he is picking up. 

Sorry I can't reply to all the comments, I didn't expect this to pick up as much as it did.

*Edit 2:Update
 Sorry It took me so long to reply I was busy with sorting this situation out.

First the fish (now named Bub) is now doing fine, he has recovered well thankfully. I thought I would lose him. 

My now EX called me from her friends phone like a week later crying saying she wants me back and that she tried to come around the house but she couldn't because I switched the lock (Thank you to the user that suggested that). She said she was sorry for hurting me but I told her I am not the one that she needed to apologize to. She refused to apologize for hurting Bub but kept saying ""I am sorry I did that to you"". 

Later I arranged for her to come pick up her stuff and she came with a box saying she bought me gifts. I refused to accept them and I didn't see where she put them after that. She said she was feeling sick and if she could lay down and I said yes, so she layed down on the lounge and after about 2 minutes she started crying again begging me to let her move back in. I didn't respond but I got up and took her box of stuff and dumped it into her car ( I felt awful doing this but I knew it had to be done). When I came back in she asked me if she could see Bud I told her ""you don't deserve to even lay your eyes on him"". She responded just by saying ""ok"". I told her it was time to go and got her to leave. On the way out she said something that broke my heart and sickened me at the same time"" Just know I still love you"".... I just closed the door in her face. 

I went to see Bud after she left and he was hiding in the corner, I think he could hear her and he was scared. 

I saw that later under the table she left the box of gifts and inside there was an Xbox one with games and a controller and a jar of **goldfish** food... "

He lives alone and we’re in a lockdown. Should we be worried? Update: Hi everyone, I'm overwhelmed by the interest and responses to this post (even if at least half of the responses were RemindMe bot requests).

I messaged a mutual friend of ours (one that's not in our friend group) yesterday and she replied saying that she'd send him a text message. I got a message from her again today letting me know that they've had a chat and he's okay and that she's thankful that I'm looking out for him.

I'm really glad he's okay, but a little bit confused and a little bit sad I guess, as to why he very suddenly went zero contact and distanced himself from our friend group. I'm wondering if maybe he just wants some space for a bit. I don't really want to do a lot of speculation otherwise.

I let the others in our friend group know that he's okay.

I sent him another text message letting him know that I'm glad he's okay, and that I'm here whenever he wants to reach out, but that it's also okay if he doesn't want to.

I'll be happy if he responds but, now that we know he's okay, I will give him space until he feels ready.

--- 

Hi reddit. We have a friend, male in his early-mid 30s who has been an active member in our friend group (8 of us altogether) for some time. Before the lockdown, we’d all see each other once a week or fortnight and we would also all regularly chat in our Facebook group chat.

During the pandemic, he lost his job but he told us that he ended up getting work with a previous employer so as far as we know, he’s still under employment, we just don’t know where. We assume he would be working from home as a software developer.

We noticed that lately he hadn’t been posting in our group chat, and the last time messenger says he “saw” our messages was on April 9th. We also have a Facebook group that he’s active in that we’re all members of, and the last time we could see a comment from him was also on the 9th.

One of us messaged him privately a few days ago and he hadn’t replied. She called him as well but the phone will ring until it reaches voicemail. Another of us rang him yesterday and got the same result. I also tried ringing him today with the same result. Sent him a text message with no reply. I can’t tell if he’s seen it.

It’s hard to go to his place right now because 1) we have a semi-lockdown in our city and 2) he lives in an apartment, we know the address but not which unit number he’s in.

We’re not sure what to do. He could be just busy with work and avoiding social media, or maybe he’s ghosting us for some reason that we don’t know of (he hasn’t blocked us or anything we can still see his profile).

Is this worth contacting police over? We’re all starting to get a bit worried but we don’t want to unintentionally escalate it if it’s nothing."

So, today morning I went to a public garden to relax and maybe study a little bit, and then I sat at a bench, after a while a lady sat next to me, she was  so nice and even offered me some snacks before going. Immediately after that, an old man who looks like he's in his 60 took her place and was like,""hey man what's with the sad look? -(because I kinda was)- did something happen?"" -To clarify things, I'm a really shy guy, I cannot control myself when talking to people I know let alone people I don't know, iow I'm really stupid when talking-.At first he sounded like a guy wanting to help so I kinda felt comfortable with him (and oh do I hate myself for that), the first thing he asked ""where do you live then?"" I almost told him where, instead the place I told him about was still close to where I live,(there's no level of stupidity beyond that), and thankfully, I did something good and did not tell him about which family I come from. So here it starts, out of nowhere he said ""so do you give blowjobs?"",  I was so scared but managed to hold myself for awhile. Now I don't know about other countries but here we have like a million word for the word blowjob, the one he said wasn't now very popular  so I tried to act as if I didn't know what that means, after he kept talking about how you should know this kind of things I said "" I did not sleep very well last night so I want to go home"", That scumbag said ""want me to take you to sleep with me?"" I took off saying that I'm going home.


Right now, I'm really sick and I don't know what to do, I can't bring this subject to my family because of how awkward it is, I tried yet I will keep trying but I don't think it getting there, I only told one friend about it but it seemed like it was too much for him, I don't want to stress more people by asking them for help, please help me

I had an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy on the 21st. Apparently the pathology results on the extracted tissue + tumor that they hadn't spotted right away on my ultrasound because my appendix was so obviously a thing = cancer, and I'm going to need another operation that will take me out of commission for at least a month.  The phone call woke me up, so I didn't have the presence of mind to ask for the name of the specific type, and am waiting on a call back with that information.

I am still out of work recovering from the first surgery, because my work is fairly physically demanding (I work night shifts in a grocery store), and I'm not supposed to lift anything over 15 lbs for another 3 weeks.  But the qualifying window for health insurance is coming up at the end of November.  It's based on accumulated worked hours over 6 months.  If I went back to work today, and were able to get 40 hours a week, I might almost make it.  But they haven't been scheduling anyone for more than 32 since June (which is why my current hour count is so low, normally I would have qualified about a week ago for the next round of insurance), plus, I still can't do a lot of the things my job requires.

I don't know what to do.  I haven't told anyone yet, and honestly, I'm not sure I want to.  This is going to sound awful, but part of me wants to just not tell anyone, and not get the surgery, and let nature take its course.  I'm already in a pretty low place from feeling like my body is failing me, and being in the middle of a divorce, and the temptation to deal with this by isolating and giving up is really, really strong.

Hi, I‘m a 15 yr old high school student from Germany. I‘m living together with my parents and my little 10 yr old sister. My sister is not very clever. To be honest, this is her 2nd year at the middle school and she’s one of the worst in her class. Actually, they almost even kicked her from school last year. She never does her homework, she gets bad grates all the time and she‘s 24/7 on her stupid phone doing god knows what. My parents already lost the hope that she’s gonna be something later. To help her to get better at school, I‘m helping her with her homework etc. 

Today I helped her with her math homework. I started to explain everything to her but like always she never listened to me. She just kept ignoring me while looking on her phone. Then she’s like „Uhh, I don’t understand. You can’t explain it bla bla bla“. That‘s her method: She always acts like I‘m not explaining it to her, she tells my parents I didn’t help her and then they blame for her grades. How would you feel when you try to help someone but he/she keeps try to get you in trouble? Anyways, this time I was sick of this. I got angry and I slapped her. It was the first time for a while that I slapped her and it felt wrong .I told her I‘m worried about her future and she needs to do something. My sister started to cry

Seconds later my father came in. He almost destroyed everything near him. My controllers, my TV, my books etc. Then he told me „You‘re not getting anything this birthday.“ (My birthday is two days). I‘m ok with that, but I‘m sad and depressed at the moment. I‘m crying in my room alone since an hour. Am I a bad brother? Did I overreact? Am I now completely unimportant in the eyes of my parents? How should I talk to them?

I‘m thankful for every answer...

Backstory: My first puppy love was my high school ex. We dated before either one of us had a car so my mom would drive to pick him up and let him come over to hang out at our house. He would check my text messages every time we saw each other.  It would make me mad but I wasn’t hiding anything so I brushed it off. One day I asked to see his phone while he was going through mine and it turns out he was cheating on me. We broke up and he wasn’t very nice afterwards. My mother stayed in contact with him. He began calling and texting my mom asking for advice and help. I told her it bothered me but she didn’t care. Eventually, she let him move into our house for some years, even when I began seeing someone new. At this point my ex had starting calling her “mom”. It made me sick to my stomach. My then boyfriend would be over all while my ex was living there. I referred to him as my God brother so that I wouldn’t have to explain the weird situation. He was always breaking things and the room he was in would stink. My ex had already moved on and had a child by this time. He confessed to my mom at some point that he thought me and him would end up together and that I would have been the one who had his child. My mom has been helping him financially for years and invites him to family holidays. I’m not sure if my entire family realizes he’s my ex when he comes to holidays or if they’ve forgotten how we know each other in the first place. My mom got married and now my step dad also treats my ex like a son. The only person who seems to understand my frustration is my new step sister. My step dad told my step sister I should just get over it even though I never got a chance to heal because he’s never left the picture. My step sister has heard how my ex talks about the money my mom and step dad have given him and she doesn’t like it. Not to mention, my ex tried hitting on my step sister and my step dad supposedly encouraged it (just to add to how weird all of this is). My mom has forced me to have my ex in my life and she acts as if he’s her son and I should be okay with it. I absolutely hate it. My ex has even “told” on me to my mom when I didn’t respond to his voicemail as if I’m required to and he apparently calls her more than I do. My mom has also told me she is irritated every time she talks to me and I wonder if she feels the same way when she talks to my ex, but I doubt she does. She has chosen him over respect for me and it hurts. We are not related and dated briefly in high school which ended due to him cheating on me. I haven’t looked at him in that way since and we really don’t get along, not even as friends. My mom just feels bad for him, but what about how I feel... Am I wrong for wanting their relationship to end? I know it won’t, but I don’t feel I’m in the wrong for wanting it to. I would never invite him to my own wedding or future family gatherings and I can see my mom getting upset about it. What do y’all think? Has anyone else gone through this? Should I just ignore it and continue not including him in my personal life or  perhaps avoid certain family get togethers if he’s going to be there even if my mom gets upset about it?

Side note: I’m in my 20’s (he’s older than me, maybe 30 I’m not sure) and if she hadn’t kept him around I would have 0 contact with him. The fact my step dad is now in on it too makes it even worse. 

Also, just want to point out one of my mother’s ex boyfriends tried contacting me to be part of an event he was putting together and I ignored his message out of respect for my mother (he cheated on her). Unfortunately she can’t say the same for me."

He told me that I shouldn't inform other tenants about this and instead I should send an email/sms and suggest them to follow public health advice. 
Do you think it's a right thing to do? Because I think that some people might not take current situation seriously since we have ""only"" around 200 confirmed cases in Poland. Some of our tenants (possibly 25% of them) is over 60 years old. I feel like if they got informed about this, they would care about themselves more seriously.

I was offered a scholarship to attend university however if I accept I’d have to live with my grandparents who drive me fucking mad and are psychological terrorists. What should I do? The title is the simplified version so here is the full story.

Worked my ass off last year for high-school and got results I am very proud of. So well that I was offered a scholarship (gives a bit of money) to a university.
If I decide to accept this university offer, which would be a bachelors of engineering (honours), I would have to live with my grandparents as my family lives so far from any university (I’m Australian). My grandfather is ok but my grandmother drives me fucking nuts and is a relentless manipulator and psychological terrorist, this is not an exaggeration I wish it was, she is responsible for many of my mother’s and aunties mental health issues.
Or I could take a gap year but then I feel as if I’m wasting time (I don’t like to waste time, extremely hate it) and then go into the degree. Another factor is I’m not even sure if I want to go to university at all but that makes me feel like I’m wasting all my efforts. My mind is in a pretty weird spot at the moment and I’m not sure what to do. I can’t afford to live on campus or any other living arrangements as my family is quite poor and even with the scholarships’ funds, can’t afford it. Any advice?

Edit: This blew up unimaginably to me and I would first of all like to thank everyone who took time out of their day to help me in this tricky time. Due to all your advice, my mind is a little clearer on the pro’s and con’s of either decision and that will help immeasurably when it comes time to make the decision. Thank you."

Since I made the first move, I'm frankly responsible for setting up what we do on our first date. What I had in mind was to fill the back of my truck with pillows and blankets and drive out to a semi-secluded area by the beach where we could hear the waves of the ocean crashing and just stargaze. I was also planning on bringing a box of pizza and some drinks too and just have a laid back time and talk with each other. My question is, if a girl did this on a first date would you freak out? Is it too much? Not enough? We only talked once at the restaurant and the rest of the times were through Snapchat but I really want him to have a good time.

I really haven't been this depressed in a while. To start with a little context; all my life I've thought of my father as a kind, hard working and honest man that wanted nothing for the best for his family. Unfortunately my perception of him has changed recently though a part of me still believes this. My older brother has always had problems with our dad. Various different things over the years some my brothers fault and some dads. I never really understood. It was only until the last year or so where my brother (26) had really started hating dad even disowning him as a   father which broke dad's heart. I'd always be on dads side as I didn't fully understand why my brother would overreact like that. My brother won't ever speak to him again as he is known to hold a grudge. It's only now I know the reason but I'm getting there. Dad and mum split up 10 years ago and about 6 months after that Mum moved in with a new boyfriend. They were technically still married. One night Dad showed up to their place (boyfriend wasnt home) and proceeded to rape my Mother. I had no idea what happened at the time as I was 9 but my brother was the one who told me this recently. How he found is complicated. I straight up did not believe him at the time and thought he was making stupid and wild accusations out of his hate for dad. I was completely convinced my own father would be incapable of doing something like this as I thought him as the most honorable and loving man. In some respects he still is and has always been a great father to his sons which make this more difficult for me. I live with Mum these days and Dad lives a few hours drive a way. Before this I kept in contact with him. Anyways I asked mum next to hear the truth. I know I shouldn't have brought the memory back up with her but I needed to know. She confirms it did happen as in her words ""he felt it was his given right"" because they were still married. I said it's no ones right to rape anyone. I was so angry. Keep In mind this happened 10 years ago and they still spoke afterwards. She just accepted it and moved on with her life after and I can't fault her for that. I haven't dealt with dad yet and he's been trying to call me as I haven't spoken to him in a while. I'm scared to face him. He doesn't know I know and mum said to just leave it. How can I but? He's a different person In my mind now and I can't speak to him like nothing happened. I know it happened a long time ago but still? I'm quite depressed and I don't know what the right thing to do is. I finally understand my brother now and his resentment but don't know if that's the way I should act. 

This is why I've posted here today. I'm not quite sure. Right now I just need help and to speak with some people about this and to hear some outside opinions/advice. Also thank you for reading."

I am a boy in my early 20’s and have recently (4months ago) moved into an apartment with my friend (let’s say Andrew), his girlfriend and my other good friend (Paul). 

One night last week all us boys, with some other friends, decided to go to the football game to enjoy our night. The night started okay but my friend Andrew, who was intoxicated began to inappropriately touch and stroke me (in my genital area) as well as my arms etc. 

I initially asked Andrew politely to stop as I did not enjoy it, however he just continued, and acted like he didn’t hear me. Keep in mind that there are other people around in the public area. However it was just not me he was touching, but it was my friends too. As I was one of the only sober ones, I believe my friends mistook this for drunk banter, however I saw it as much more.  

The night continued and Andrew got a lot more drunk and “friendly” and even wouldn’t let me pass the aisle until he got a “kiss on the cheek” from me. I told him no, and he wouldn’t let me passed. I ended up going down the other end to get out. 

Later in the night when we were on our way out of the stadium, he began to put his arms around my shoulders and get up close to show me a video on YouTube. I asked him, for the 50th time, to not touch me and that he could show it to me at an arms length. He still refused to let go. I then proceeded to raise my voice to let him know that once again, I didn’t like being touched. He then turned to me, with anger in his eyes, began to shoulder charge me twice, and then threw me into a metal pole (because he didn’t like that I stood up to him to say no). I never retaliated to this push, but my other friend Paul (sober) was there and witnessed it all.

As we all live together it was an awkward ride home to say the least, where he even continued to touch my leg on the train despite all the earlier commotion. Prior to the train, he shook my hand and begged for my forgiveness on the night, which I gave him. 

After the train, there were also heated discussions on the walk home by himself as he kept probing me to throw a punch and said that “I wouldn’t want to fight me”. I did not and continued to ignore him as I just want to get home. We ended up going back to our house where I packed some stuff and went home to my parents that night to think about what had happened. I was emotionally upset. 

Since then, we have exchanged some Facebook messages, in order for me to tell him how I felt by him both touching and pushing me. He has not accepted what he did (whilst drunk) and has denied it all. 

I do not want to go back to live in that house, as I will not feel comfortable in my own home. I believe he will/has turned his girlfriend against me and it will be a toxic environment for me to live in. 

I have been made out to be the bad guy in all of this (he has twisted it) and does not see that he indeed sexually assaulted me despite me saying no. 

There has been a previous instance last year before I was living with him, where he was drunk and touched me similar to last night (however I brushed it off).I even sent his girlfriend a message on the night saying that it was upsetting me and inappropriate.

I am in a 1 year lease which ends in January, but I want to move out immediately (I can afford it, it’s just logically getting in another person to cover me). Please help me with advice.

FYI - I was sober and do not drink alcohol. 

EDIT- I have changed the offenders name from James to Andrew, to avoid any unwanted comments regarding James Charles."

He also called both my mom and brother when I didn’t answer his (5) calls over two days. He says he just wanted to make sure I was okay but I texted him one of those days. 

He also told my mom to call him when I wasn’t around and thought I didn’t hear. I later found out it was because he told my mom to tell me to go to the military. I told him many times in sessions that I didn’t want to go to the military because he brought it up every session. 

My mom says it was her idea but I know that was a lie. 

She says “Do you know that if he was telling me things about your sessions that that would be an illegal hippa violation? You need to call him and apologize!” 

I feel like he DID violate hipaa but in a sneaky “loophole” way. I spoke to a family member whose family member owns a law firm (meaning I can’t use them) and they said they *technically* didn’t violate because it can be assumed that I said this was okay (agreeing when he asked to meet my family and when he insisted on letting her come in or call when she asked but I ORIGINALLY said NO ) but it seems wrong so I should report if I can"

They both say it was consensual. Should I just be okay with it? Here's the story..

She was staying with me for a week, sleeping on my couch. She lives in a different city and visits me every summer. It's always super fun to have her here!

I had a small gathering, at the end of the night she and my friend went to ""buy smokes"". They were both a bit drunk, not very drunk but they each had had a few drinks. She texted me 15 minutes later saying she was going to smoke a joint with him, that she'd probably get sleepy and stay over at his place (he lives 4 blocks from me).

So they hooked up.

She's had many partners, even at 19. I support her exploring her sexuality. I just tell her to be safe, and she insists she always is. But, she's also had some mental health issues..depression, adhd. She's on anti-depressant meds. Obviously my friend knows nothing about that since it's her business.

He's a very sexual person as well. Not a predator or anything, but he does hook up with a lot of women. 

So, they are both very sexual people and insist it was enjoyable and loving and safe. I believe them. But, something feels..icky. He's so much older and I feel like if the positions were reversed, I would have sent her home. I consider myself to be a very liberal, progressive person and I have no religious or mental hangups about sex.

It's driving me crazy. I can't stand to hang out with the guy now, but, he's such a dear friend so it's tearing me apart. I want to be okay with this but I'm not sure I should be. I brought it up with him and he said he's very sorry it's making me anxious, but insists he did nothing wrong, that it's not about me at all - it was just two people I love enjoying each other physically.

Why does this feel so strange to me? My gut says it's some long, lost parental instinct kicking in but it feels..bigger than that. Any advice is appreciated.

Is there any nice way to help my wife understand the unnecessary danger we are putting our children in? I brought this up at our pediatrician and she agreed with me and said flat out she does not let her kids play with un-vaccinated children. My wife shrugged it off because they are old college friends and she does not deal well with conflict. I'm honesty concerned about the health of my children and that of the people attending these parties.

Update
Okay thanks for all the help! I have spoken to my wife at this time we are most likely not going to allow our 1yro around this family. And we will definitely be notifying all parents about the potential risk without naming these children or family. If it makes as many people uncomfortable as I think it might we may choose to uninvite this family. Again thanks this has been much more helpful than I thought it would be.

I'm struggling to cope. Just my story.

It all happened one year ago exactly. March 8th, 2018. I've finally got up the courage to write this all out in a throwaway account. Today was the day my brother killed himself. It started a few days before he died actually. I had walked past his room one day and noticed a rope on his bed. I didn't really think anything of it. Until the night he passed away. One year ago today I was watching tv when i heard the front door open and close. I looked out the window and saw him walking outside with a backpack on. It was 11 p.m. so i was confused. Then something came over me, a felt a weird feeling of dread that something was really off. I honestly don't know how to describe it, i've never felt anything like it. I went outside to see what he was doing.

Now we live in the countryside with some woods on one side of our property, which is the way he was heading. He had reached the edge of the woods by the time I caught up with him. I shouted his name and when he turned around i knew something was seriously wrong. He was in a t-shirt so his arms were exposed. He had so many cuts his arms were covered in blood, and he was crying. I immediately tried to get him to come back inside and asked him what was wrong. He refused to move. After some questioning which kind of turned into arguing. He kept saying he was depressed and wasn't worth living. But i never would have thought it, he was always a happy person. So as bad as it sounds i kind of didn't believe him, but there was also no way of deny the harm he brought on himself. I tried to reason with him why he should come back and get some help. But he kept refusing. I tried everything i knew. I tried to let him know people cared and that he was a great person and i don't even remember what I all said. We ended up just yelling back and forth at each other for a few minutes, which at this point i realised my brother was not in a good mindset and I was crying too at this point because i was really getting scared.

Then he just shouted it out. ""Im a pedophile"". He said he was disgusting human being with a sick fucked up head who deserved nothing but pain and death. I won't ever forget everything he said. I was stunned. I couldn't really take it all in. I begged him that we could get him help but he wouldnt listen. He said no one helps pedo's and that it would only make things worse. Then he ran away. I tried to catch him but he was much faster than me and i wasn't in a good state as it was. I looked for nearly 30 minutes before i found him. Hanging from a tree, from the rope that i'd seen laying on his bed a few days earlier. I don't remember much of what happened afterwards. I remember crying, vomiting, the police, my parents breaking down. The long therapy sessions, trying to continue living. I'll skip all that stuff though.

I still feel like its my fault, i should have done something, i dont know what or how. It's just hard to accept it all. I hadn't told anyone this story, aside from my therapist. No one else knows my brother was a pedophile and thats why he was struggling and why he killed himself. Not even our parents. I didn't tell them because i don't want his life tarnished. He was such a good person and my best friend. He was so close to graduating college and he was the nicest person i knew, and best brother i could have asked for. He was so much more than a pedophile, I just wish i could have gotten him too see that. I can still hear my mom crying at night sometimes. Our house is just eerily quite now, everything is different now. I think i'm going to go up the tree he killed himself at tonight and lay some flowers. I know it will be hard, i'm crying just writing this post but idk. I just miss my brother.

Also for those wondering, from what I got out of him he never touched a kid and he did admit to seeing cp once. I looked at his computer afterwards and found nothing out of the ordinary. It was the guilt of being one that pushed him over the edge. Lots of his search history was about mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and of course pedophilia. He just hid it so well.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for everyone's support. It's been a really rough day, but i'm making it through."

I’m using a throwaway purely for the sake on anonymity. Short backstory: met this girl at college, got to know her over the course of a few semesters and am just hopelessly in love with her. So I asked her out, told her how I felt. To which she said, no. 

Lot of us have been there, rejected, defeated, and depressed. I was absolutely crushed. It STILL hurts, now a few months later. I tried to get over her, tried so many different ways. I took a break from seeing her. Now we’re back as best friends again, and I’m really trying to not fall back in love with her. I want to be her best friend and not have to worry about me falling in love all over again, but I’m really having a hard time with it. Any advice is welcome!"

Clearly she doesn't remember a time when we were all living together. Her mom has a son from a previous relationship and just had another with her current partner, the one that she left for when my daughter was 2. My daughter is very smart and I've always been as honest with her as I feel she can handle. She knows that her mom met her current partner and wanted to live with him. I've also done my best to let her know that it has nothing to do with her. She resides with me and has a happy and comfortable life. We live very close to her mom's family and all get along quite well. They visit or babysit daily. 

ANYWAY I was cleaning up some school papers she had scattered on the table and came across a letter she wrote to her mom that said something along the lines of 'Mom, I miss you. Why did you have to break up with Dad? Please don't show this to Dad, I'm just asking.' 

Sooo I asked her about it and she kind of blew it off like meh idk. I don't want to pry. I also don't want her to feel like she can't talk to me. Like I said, I've always been honest with her and we have great communication I think. I guess I'm just asking if anybody has any advice for a situation like this? Should I tell her mom and make sure she's being open with her? Or just leave it alone and hope that if she wants to talk or has questions, she'll ask.



UPDATE: I talked to my daughter about it again. She asked a couple of generic questions that she already knew the answers to. I asked if she wanted to send the letter to her mom and she was firm in the stance that she did not want to do that. I asked if she wanted me to talk to her mom about talking with her and she said no. I asked if she wanted to write another letter together - no again. I told her that's fine but if she needs to talk or has questions, she has me, her mom, her mamaws, or her counselor. She wanted more information about the counselor, so I told her we could go back in after school tomorrow to meet them. I asked if there was anything specific she wanted to talk about that she didn't feel comfortable talking to me or other family members about and she said yeah, the stuff you just asked me about. So yes, family dynamics are bothering her. She seems a little confused but the counselor surely has the tools available to help her express herself however she needs to. I want to thank you all for your help. This was my first real reddit post and I'm shocked by the feeling of community and support here. Amazing!"

I'm 27F. Don't know where to go from here. Hello. Sorry in advance if this is not well written, my thoughts are a total jumble right now. 

I spent 8 years living overseas and had been with my (now ex) fiance for 2 years when last spring, my dad had a heart attack. He asked me to come home and help out and I did. It was just before the time my fiance and I were about to apply for visas etc for me to stay over there - so when I left, I didn't have a visa to go back on. 

Shortly after I returned home, I was doing my best to help my dad around the home. He'd spent a month in hospital and had ended up having the triple heart bypass, so he was pretty weak at that time. 

My dad is a bit of a clean freak so I took extra care to make sure everything was left as I found it. I was washing a glass when he suddenly snapped at me for wasting water and that I was to do all washing up in one go. I was shocked given that I had left my entire life behind to help him and he still found something to snap at me about. I calmly left the room when he accused me of having an attitude and said I was no longer welcome to live with him. He kicked me out knowing at that time I didn't really have anywhere else to go. I ended up sleeping on a friends sofa bed for a while.

I did go back to live there about a week later as it just didn't seem practical for me to sleep on my friends sofa bed indefinitely and she didn't really have the room. He didn't apologise when I went back and instead talked the whole time about how upset he had been and how devastated he had been. 

I kind of knew from that point on to keep myself to myself. I was trying to save money to pay for a partnership visa to go back to my fiance (expensive) when the distance became too much for us and we broke up. I would stay out of my dads way at home because I was frightened to disagree with him on anything in case he would kick me out again. I started medication for anti depressants last Summer, which I'm still on now. I guess these made it easier for me to ignore when something upset me. But he found every little thing to have a dig at me about. Whether I'd left a pair of shoes by the front door (where he kept his) or whether I'd put something in the fridge instead of the cupboard where he said it belonged (eggs). It was just everything and I learned to go along with it because I was saving to leave and the rent I was paying was cheaper than if I was renting a room somewhere. He even snapped at me for wanting a bath on a Saturday evening at 8pm because it was 'too late.' 

So fast forward to Thursday evening. It was his retirement party. I will admit, I had a few drinks on an empty stomach and was feeling no pain. Dad had been drinking quite a bit too. He introduced me to everyone and they all commented how I was my dads 'princess' and that he talked me up all of the time. I was quite surprised given that he didn't even seem to like me at home. 

In the taxi home, my dad battered me. I wish I could remember why but I can't. I was later taken to hospital with multiple head injuries, cut to my ear, a split lip, cuts all over my face, most of my fingernails (which had been acrylics) had been ripped off, and I later developed a pretty awful black eye. He gave me one once before when I was 14, but never this bad. I had been pinned in the foot well of the taxi whilst he had been hitting me and I couldn't move. When we got out of the taxi, I tried to get into the house because I had nowhere to go, and as I tried to get in, he knocked me to the ground again and began hitting me again. There was blood on the stairs. The neighbours called the police and my dad was arrested on ABH charges while my mum and my step dad came to get me and took me to the hospital. I'm now living with them (they have converted their dining room into a bedroom for me and have been incredible.)

The police asked whether I wanted to press charges and whether I wanted to make a statement. This was only about 8-9 hours after the incident and I was not sure at that time. They then asked if I would make a decision and come back on Wednesday to let them know what I wanted to do. The policewoman seemed like she wanted me to press charges. 

Since then I've just been in shock. Dad has tried to contact me. He sent me an essay about how much he loves me and misses me and is devastated by 'whats happened'. (No apology) I have not responded. He also sent my mum a lengthy message about how 'I need to consider how my mental health affects those around me.' 

I'm just in shock. Mum has said I can live here until I've saved up enough to make some decisions. I just don't know whether to press charges. Or anything. I can't go back to work for a week due to my injuries. Luckily my boss has been fantastic. 

How do I move on from this? 

tl;dr - dad beat me up and I don't know what happens next.


EDIT: Thank you for the advice and words, everyone. I read all of your comments and they have helped provide a clearer view of the situation. It's difficult to see from your own point of view sometimes, especially so soon after it happened. My boss has come round to see me today and he has been lovely as well. I have some time off work to process things. The police did say they may press charges whether I make a statement or not, given my injuries. I'm just still in shock and I can't believe this has happened. I would like to clarify that my ex-fiance didn't break up with me - it was a decision that I made based on our own relationship not working that the distance highlighted to me. He and I have remained friends and he is pretty horrified by what has happened. Thank you all so much for your comments and kind, supportive words. I will provide an update for you as soon as I can. Xx

I will try to get a doctor to tell me what options I have, to see if there's a therapeutic group or something I'd be able to attend. I have a lot to figure out, but I actually feel much more assured now. It isn't the end of the world, and I can still make some of my dreams come true since I managed to survive through all of this. I will do my very best to reply to the comments in the following days. I want you all to know how grateful I am.





I'm mentally ill. I've seen lots of professionals since I was 14, but nobody has ever given me a diagnosis. I overdosed on 3000 mg of Sertraline/Zoloft last Thursday. An ambulance transported me to the hospital after I called an emergency service because I panicked when I started feeling super sick. I was at the intensive care unit for a day, then they transported me to a psych ward even though I wasn't okay physically yet. Now I'm okay, no internal damage or anything. Today, the doctors told me: ""We can't help you with suicidal thoughts and tendencies here. It can't be cured with meds."" Basically, they wanted me to go back home today. I asked them if I could stay until the end of the week because I know that if I leave now, I'm going to try to kill myself again.


My mother is very angry at me. She doesn't want me to live with my family anymore because apparently, I make her worry about me every single day by being like this, and she told me she was sick of it. I'm 19. I live in the Czech republic. I haven't finished high school yet, I probably never will. My mother said she'll go see the headmaster and tell her that I'm dropping out. 


I don't even know why I'm writing this. There's still a tiniest bit of hope inside me, I suppose. But I can't get a job without a degree here. I can't finish high school because my anxiety is insane. Homeschooling isn't allowed in this country. If nobody over here is willing to help, it's unlikely that anyone else will. "

So here’s the tea....I’m about to go to college I’m a eighteen year old senior and have already applied to the college I’ve always wanted to go to.Recently I’ve decided to register to live in the dorms since it’s a hour long commute to my college and I’d just find it more beneficial to live on campus instead of going home and back.

The problem is that my parents are very overprotective and conservative and they recently found out that my college has a predominately black environment and that caused a HUGE problem for them and on top of that they don’t want me living in a dorm and get extremely angry when the topic of dorms is brought up.

Money isn’t an issue I have scholarships and a collage fund that I can use to pay for my tuition and dorms.I just don’t want to hurt the relationship I have with my parents by just up and leaving .sooo what’s the best way of breaking it to them that I’m moving into a dorm?

Also just found out that my tuition fund is under their name...."

By a good friend of mine, I actually mean that unlike some people from our school that are just ironically his friends. 

I like to play GTA V with my friend and I have been playing it A LOT with him. I've never really had someone to play with before and this is causing a problem because Fs mom has told that he isn't allowed to play with me for a month. 

F told me his mom doesn't like him playing with me, because she thinks I force F to play with me (we do play a fuck ton) even though I've never even said anything more to him than ""Hey come to play"" or ""when can you come to play today?"". 

F also told me that his mom thinks that I'm going to take over Fs pc and steal all the data from it and we speak to each other through discord so whenever F talks about screen sharing he is told not to allow me to do anything on his pc.

&amp;#x200B;

Then F said his mom is worried I might take advantage of him because he is autistic (I think) and he shouldn't get too close with me. (By taking advantage I think he means that I'd scam him for money or something like that) At the end of the day, I'm just an introverted kid that just wants someone to play with.

&amp;#x200B;

The heck am I supposed to do? I found out about this today and I've thought about telling my homeroom teacher about this and telling my mom about this. I've even told F that I am willing to talk with his mom and disprove any claim that she might have about me being a dick to her son. 
I'm lost here and need advice.

Edit: I am 16 and F is 17

&amp;#x200B;

Update: since F was dodgy about this when I said to him I am willing to talk to his mom and asked when would this be OK I figured he was just trying to protect my emotions and all.

 (I do tend to get hot headed in the heat of the battle and direct my emotions somewhere and he is apologizing and all even though it's not his fault most of the time) 

 I also asked F over text because I felt it was easier for him to answer because it would have been easier for me to do that in his position.

And the conversation went something like this:

Me: Hey F you know you don't have to play with me every afternoon? I'm fine with playing by myself and I don't care about  me having to play alone.

F: ?

Me: Were you really told not to play with me or did you just say you were told not to? Because it really won't bother me if you just didn't want to say it straight.

F: I am allowed to play with you.

So I guess this was a bit of an over reaction but I will take some of your advice and do something else with him"

I'm having a really hard time with a lot of things in my life right now. My father started to verbally abuse me and my sisters since I was 6 or 7. My oldest sister got depression and whatever she did was just written off as ""she has depression do it's ok for her to do whatever"". Since I can't remember anything before 6, I kinda just thought what my dad did was what all parents do. My mom became toxic when I was about 10. She locked me in a bathroom for a day or two with only water. Then every one of my birthdays, I woke up, went to swim practice, came home, and was locked in my room. With no food (except for my storage which was only a few non-perishables). Whenever my parents got into a fight, my dad would leave, my mom would scream at us, and then leave while my oldest is begging for her to not go. This would happen only at my house and theme parks. About three months ago my dad became angry for some reason I can't remember. My sister and I got into a fight and she stomped off. About 5 minutes later I wanted to go find her to apologize, but my dad screamed at me that if I didn't let her go, I wouldn't get dinner. So I went to find my sister. My mom had just come downstairs and asked Dad what happened and then screamed at him because a few minutes later I was heading back inside and my mom went to Rachel, talked with her, then left. My dad left shortly after. My dad and mom decided to get a divorce, but where I live, you have to live separately for one year before you can. So my dad got an apartment and this is where my memory of what my parents did to me came back. I stopped loving them. I kept me having depression a secret. I didn't do a social studies essay. Eventually I told my mom everything. Especially that I think I have depression. She says ok and that she'll take me to a therapist the next week. Two months go by and no therapist. Then I see my older sister vaping today. I don't want to live anymore. My life is living hell. The only reason I haven't committed yet, is because of my boyfriend and best friend. But my life is slowly becoming worse.

I had posted a comment earlier about this and I deleted it because it was confusing and I have more information now. Sorry for the long comment...

Edit: thank you everyone. I made this last night before I went to bed, and when I woke up this post had lots of comments from everyone. Plus the additional private discussions and messages. I'm trying to go through all of your comments but there are about 200 so it will take awhile. Everything I've read so far has made me cry (in a good way?) And has helped so much. For once in my life I feel loved.

Update:
So this happened a few days ago and I didn't feel like updating until now. Also, my mom did a lot of stuff, but my dad is worse. She only became toxic because she had been with my dad so long it was the only thing she knew. This kinda relates to what I'm about to say...

So every year in science we get a STEM project where we have to work in a group and bring stuff in to build something. Basically a science fair but more specific and less research. We are given 2 days in class to work on it. My partner and I decided I would bring the stuff in and the day comes and I forget both my phone and the stuff. I ask my sister to text my mom to ask her to bring it (my dad is in San Salvador on a vacation with others from my church). My mom gets angry and says she'll be late for school (she's a teacher) if she brings it and says she drop it off to me at the sidewalk in front of my school if I wait for her. She then starts yelling at me about how I have to have a months worth of homework done AND my room sparkling clean by the time she gets home, and starts to talk about other stuff that basically sounds like she won't bring the stuff. So I head inside instead of wait for her and she apparently was still going to drop it off. So she has to go through the line of parents and gives it to the office people and she sends a text on my phone calling me a b***h and saying that I'll be grounded for 5 months and she won't bring me to any cookie booths (I'm a girl scout). So, I break down during the school day multiple times. Though nobody seems to care because everyone else is so caught up in their own ""perfect world"" in which they joke about divorce and depression. Anyway, I get pulled aside by my English teacher (who probably hates me) and she says my sister was worried about me and that I can talk to the counselor of I want to. I said no because I didn't want to have my mom taken away. When I get home I start to clean my room and I'm halfway through when my mom calls and says she's sorry. She then tells me that I don't have to do my room and keeps apologizing, this is why I like my mom more. While she messes up, she apologizes for everything while my dad just writes it off as my fault. When my mom gets home, my sister runs upstairs and my mom comes in crying. I find out that my sister lied to the counselor at her school and said that my mom was going to physically abuse us (which neither of my parents have done). So now my mom might be taken away by CPS and I might be forced to live with my dad 24/7... I should also mention how I told 2 of my friends and they have been really helpful. One of them is willing to pick me up whenever and take care of me. She's even prepared an extra room in her house in case my parents do something. On Monday (27? Maybe 28) my dad is coming back from San Salvador. So I will try to update then because something might happen. By something, I mean that I'm going to be really sad because of the way my dad acts when he ""misses"" me and my sisters."

I have also been blanking him, the way he treated my mother was unacceptable during this period, though they are divorced he told me that her divorcing him was likely why she got the cancer which obviously makes no sense. 

However my Dad pays the bills, to his one credit of being a multi-millionaire asshole, thus he has always paid for my phone contract and is now tracking me because I have decided I don't want to speak to him due to the way he handled the situation with my mother and also how he generally treats people. To him nothing was his fault and it was my mum's fault for not loving him enough that he cheated on her with multiple people and her friends.

To make things worse I am currently at University and planning on dropping out considering that it's not for me, he has already payed for the full year and will likely go ape shit for me making a decision without his approval. All my friends have me on this phone number and I want to keep it, but I probably won't be able to because of this tracking and constant spamming of calls to me.

All he cares about is his social image, any of the one or two times we see him a year he posts it all over twitter saying how much of a good time we had. Anyway I'm done and I need to keep my phone number but change contract so he can't track me and spam me with calls and texts about how he is disappointed in me. Can you imagine having the right to say you are disappointed when you ran off with other women, blamed cancer on my mother's decision to divorce and constantly go through my younger sister's phone which usually makes her cry when he critiques literally everything. I want to keep my number but need a new contract that I pay for?"

I don't know what people do on dates, no clue, and I am a generally socially awkward person.

What's the best approach to this? How do I keep the conversation flowing? How can I make sure I'm safe? How do I get out if I'm feeling uncomfortable? I'm living far from home, so I can't fake a call from my mom and leave for a family emergency.

UPDATE

I went on the date, it was at the park, so a safe space, nothing to worry about. I asked him about the usual stuff, he's here for school so I asked him about it. He doesn't go to a regular university, he goes to military college in the US, so he just went on and on speaking about his army buddies and the crazy pranks they pull on each other (i.e. just beating eachother up). I wasn't into it, it was clear as day, my face can't hide emotions, but he just kept going and showing me videos of him training with guns. I'm European, I don't care about guns, I actively dislike guns.

Anyhow, I brought up national stereotypes because he was the embodiment of every US army bro stereotype, that conversation died out quickly because he wanted to do what crazy stuff I do for fun. I read for fun, I watch TV for fun, when I hung with friends it's low-key and we have a great time just talking to each other. So this died out soon too and he went back to showing me stuff on his phone.

We got to talking about music, again, nothing in common except for the fact that we both like Britney Spears's Oops I did it again, but he didn't care at all about my music, he just clicked through his playlists. 
 
I tried asking about his family, his answers were brief and he didn't ask the same question to me. 
He then tried to kiss me, I let him, but stopped him from going any further.

Before getting there, I told him I had to leave at a specific time to catch the bus back, so we started walking back and I spoke about school, since getting my degree is the thing I care about the most right now and I genuinely love learning and school. Again he showed no interest. He left me like half a kilometre before my bus stop and we just said goodbye.

Somewhere in the midst of all this, he takes the umbrella out of my backpack to fidget with it and then he just leaves it there. He made lose my brand new umbrella!

Anyway, I definitely didn't enjoy the date, if he's oblivious to it and asks me out again, I'll be polite but upfront. I don't think we could work together, and even if we could, nothing could come of it because he's in the US army and I'm working towards a degree that's useless outside of Europe, so it all works out in the end.
I'm sure one day he'll find a great army wife, but it's most definitely not me.

I'm still glad I went, even if I lost my umbrella, I got over the nerves of my first date ever and next time maybe will be better, even if I'm not counting on it."

He and I don’t really talk so I was quite surprised. I took the call because I figured that he wouldn’t call if it wasn’t important. 
He called to ask for advice, he’s pretty lost right now and he doesn’t know what to do. He just separated from his girlfriend (who just terminated her pregnancy). He doesn’t have a place anymore because once they broke up he had to give up the apartment since he couldn’t afford it on his own. And he doesn’t have a job. He’s looking for a fresh start and he confessed that he’d like to stay at his grandpa’s place for a some time until he finds a job and is back on his feet. 


His parents had a nasty divorce and his dad doesn’t speak to him anymore because my nephew didn’t side with him in the divorce (his dad is an proper a-hole). My sister is not better. She never properly took care of her four children and doesn’t really care. He doesn’t want to ask them for help. 


He called me because he knows it’s easier to talk to me than to my dad (his grandpa). I’m 27, there’s a big age difference between my siblings and I and I’m close in age with my nieces and nephews. 


The thing is, I called my dad and he’s not really open to the idea of helping him. My nephew had a ‘wild’ phase a few years back and my dad is stuck on that. He doesn’t trust him and he doesn’t want to open his house to someone he doesn’t trust (understandably). 


I called my other sister for advice and she told me she talked to my nephew a few times and she feels he’s really tryin to change but just doesn’t know how. I was quite surprised because she wasn’t my nephew’s biggest fan so for her to say that, it must really mean he’s changing. Also, she said that for him to call us must mean that he’s really desperate. And when I had him on the phone, I felt that. I actually think he must be homeless right now (even though he didn’t say anything about that). 

My dad said that we needed to discuss that together as a family and make a decision. So here’s my dilemma: how can I help him without putting at risk my relationship with my dad? If I convince my dad to help him and he screws it’s up, I will be responsible. But at the same time, it’s really breaking my heart right now, and it makes me cry just imagining what he’s going through. I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t do anything."

I (20F) am in college. In my earliest class of the day this one guy seems to be crushing real hard which is fine but he's rather annoying, constantly talks over the professor, shakes the table, obviously doesn't pay attention which is fine but leave me out of your slacking right? He's recently been going out of his way to do the MOST to talk or be near me and this other girl. I've tried dropping hints like ""oh my boyfriend said this restaurant..."" but he doesn't seem to get it. I've told him I'm trying to pay attention he will be quiet all of 30 seconds. It's getting to the point where it's just flat out annoying, I don't want to hurt his feelings but I'm so over it and I wanna help this other girl who is also stuck in this annoying ass loop.

Info: I have moved seats, many times, he gets there early so he chooses to sit next to me. Even if I say the seat next to me is taken he'll sit one away and still try and talk to me.

More info: I now see how grown man confused people. He is 45, he almost brags about it. Hence why I haven't talked to my professor, he and they are very buddy buddy, I haven't reported him to the school because I've been told nothing will be done and people in the office will no longer like me. As sad as it sounds I am a club treasurer so I have to work closely with admins to get stuff done, and according to multiple girls who've reported incidents like harrassment and even rape, nothing is done and the people in the office get very annoyed with those people and begin to refuse to work with them. I go to a very small private college so this isnt something I can work around.

Update: In class today I told him to stop talking to me about 15 times throughout the class period (I tried to count). I purposely acted pissy and annoyed, and he kept at it. At the end of the class when we were walking out he asked me ""you okay? you seem annoyed today"" and I said yes, I want to pay attention to class not talk to him about superbowl memes. He got mad at me saying stuff like ""I thought we were friends, good to see this is how older people get treated."" At this point I was pretty scared because I'm 4'10 and he's like 6'. So I just walked away. I'm scared to go to class again on Friday, I don't think it's smart to tell the office but I should anyways? 

More Info: Yes he has been flirting, I purposely left out details about things he's said to me as they are really crude and I don't feel comfortable saying them."

I can have a really hard time with social norms so I'm not sure if he would appreciate it or find it creepy. When I was in elementary school I had a principle that was more or less a guardian angel to me while my dad was relapsing and couldn't take care of me. I never had food/was always hungry when I came to school and got bullied by the other students because I was usually dirty (and also a nerd). My teachers ignored all the red flags and just labeled me as a bad kid, even blaming me on getting bullied. 

Mr. S was the only real teacher that took my side growing up. I remember when he came into class and saw that I had no food he would quietly take me to the canteen to eat for free. All I really remember about him now is that he was an old man with an accent and an 80s style track suit. It was a big deal to me at the time because of what I was going through but I got taken away by CPS and never got to say goodbye or thank him. I've graduated now and I'm in uni, and I really think that he helped change my life for the better by believing in me and helping me through that time but I dont know if it would be worth it to reach out and tell him."

Think town hall meeting, but obviously we aren’t having town hall meetings at the moment. 

I stand by my comments 100% and I fully accept that I made my bed and I now must sleep in it, but Facebook is exploding with people saying that it was shameful for me to make the statements I did. People are upset because many love the person and institution that I criticized. Many others do not but are afraid to speak up because they don’t want to end up like I have. 

This could affect my career, too, as I’m employed in a related organization that could become part of the group I criticized, which is what prompted me to speak out. I’m genuinely trying to prevent a big mistake from happening. Think consolidating town departments. Like if I worked for the parks and rec dept and they wanted to combine us with sanitation and many people love the sanitation director, but I have inside info proving he’s an incompetent asshole, and that this would make both departments worse. That’s what I shared in a public forum and people are pissed.

Background knowledge: My grandfather recently passed away due to cancer he was battling for two years. Because of this, my family and I felt obligated to move in with my grandma because she is old and felt lonely. My siblings and I really didn’t know my grandparents growing up. My mother was estranged from them since I was a toddler (I AM AN ADULT now -19 years old), so I have no recollection of them. She stopped talking to them because my older sister said that my grandfather had molested her while she was living with them, and she referred to my sister as a b****. They didn’t start talking again until three years ago. 

Anyways, I’ll get back on topic. We finally moved in last week because we had to save up money to move states to live with her. The past three days, my grandmother has told me to turn around, so she can take pictures of my butt because “she loves her granddaughter’s butt.” She’ll also start talking about the pants that I’m wearing saying I look great in them or that I have her flat butt (I have never been told I have a flat butt until then... I believe it’s normal sized, but that’s still a weird thing to say?), that I’m so beautiful, and she even grabbed my butt. She’ll like shower me with compliments before and while she wants to take pictures of my butt. The first day, I thought maybe she was doing it as a harmless joke, but she made me pose in two different ways. The second time, I got really weirded out. The third time, I didn’t wanna do it, and it was in front of my entire family, even my dad. The fourth time was in public at a park, once again in front of my family. She made me stop as we were leaving to take pictures of my butt. In each photo, I WAS fully clothed, however. She made me turn around to take pictures of my butt twice yesterday, and that morning, I was pretending to sleep because I heard her on the phone with some man. I found this odd because my grandpa died only ONE MONTH AGO. I could tell she was trying to whisper, and she kept repeating, “hi baby, hey babyyyyy, hi babyyyyyy.” I instantly wondered if she had been flirting with a man from online because she doesn’t really ever get out of the house. 

After we got home from the park yesterday, I told my younger brother I had felt uncomfortable about grandma taking pictures of my butt. He said I looked weirded out while it was happening then told me he looked at grandma’s Facebook and that it said she’s engaged to this man from Afghanistan... I immediately felt my heart drop, and after examining her Facebook profile (which none of us are friends with her on), I saw that she would type up in her bio what she’s looking for in a man, and it said who she was engaged to. I started putting two and two together, and I think my grandmother may be using those inappropriate photos of me to send to her “fiancé”, acting like she is me. 

Another thing I noticed is that she’ll only want pictures of my face alone. She never asks my little brothers to come there so she can take pictures of them. They’ll only be included of family photos that she takes. My aunt once told me that Grandma used to make her daughters (including my mother) model their new bras and panties for her and my grandpa and that one of my aunts was molested by my grandfather. My grandmother apparently knew about it too. 

I know this story sounds insane (because it is) and probably funny to some people out there, but please do not write any mean comments. I feel violated by my grandmother’s actions. 

My question here is: Do I have a right to feel this way, or am I overreacting to this situation? What should I do? Thank you to anyone who replies. 

[EDIT]: To anyone who will ask, I allowed my grandmother to do it because I’m afraid my mom will think I’m disrespecting my grandmother if I don’t. My mom gets mad easily, and I think she’ll just keep yelling at me for it saying my grandma is just playing with me or something. I was just trying to avoid confrontation. "

My family does not like my cat so I’m the sole person that takes care of her. She’s been exiled from the rest of the house and has lived in my room and bathroom for 2 years now. It’s not too small a space and she’s got all her playthings and a cat tree by a big window so she’s ok there. I go to college 1000 miles away from home and I’m in a dorm so I can’t take Athena with me until next year when I can live off campus. Last year my family took care of her alright, they fed her, scooped her poop, and sometimes played with her. I always felt bad that I wasn’t there to properly take care of her but this was the best I could do. (Side note I am not close with my family for many reasons and I’ve tried to move out before)

This year the summer before I went back to school. My mom said I would have to give her away because they refuse to take care of her again. I refuse to give her away and eventually I talk my brother into taking care of her if I pay him $50 a month. It’s overpriced but worth it if I don’t lose my baby. I ask for picture updates of her to make sure she’s ok and every so often I get pictures of her outside. Apparently they let her outside sometimes, which isn’t that unusual since I do so also. The difference is that I stay with her outside to monitor her and make sure she doesn’t eat the plants bc some could be poisonous. She’s an inside cat and isn’t used to being outside so she’s less scared if I’m there. 

A week ago my parents flew up to visit me from Fri-Tue. On Monday I found out that my parents let Athena outside on Friday and my brother had not seen her since then. He had purposely left her outside to fend for herself while he went to the beach with his friends. I know this was on purpose because when I confronted him about it he just said “she’ll be fine”. You can imagine how upset I am. He doesn’t listen to me so I get my mom to talk him into looking for her which he puts off until the next day. 

This becomes a recurrent pattern of me giving them suggestion after suggestion of where to look and what to do and them not doing it until the next day or so because they’re “busy”. Or they just straight up don’t respond to my texts. I am doing EVERYTHING I can do 1000 miles away to help find her. I’ve told them what streets to look on, neighbors to check with, what shelters to call, I’ve posted on websites, I’ve made flyers. She’s been missing for a week now and they’ve given up looking and still haven’t passed out the flyers I made.

TLDR: I paid my family well to take care of my cat while I’m away at school and when they lost her they don’t care enough to look for her properly. 

Idk what else to do. This is the last straw for me and I really want to cut my toxic family out of my life.

Edit: thank you so much for your help and advice, there’s a lot more messages than I expected so I’m sorry if I didn’t respond to yours. I will update when I have news

Edit: paying my brother to take care of her was a last resort option and there are many other reasons why I’m not close with my family that I will not share here

How would you behave in my situation? (Happened to me yesterday) It’s 10:30pm.

I was going home from work while listening to music. And I saw a guy yelling at the girl. So I paused my music and slowed down to see what happens and if the girl needs my help. And she needed indeed.

The guy took the girl and started to shake her. Then he threw her to the ground.

I immediately yelled at the guy and approached him and he approached me. I asked what the hell is he doing? He yelled at me “it’s not your business, go your own way”.

I continued conversation and started thinking of next actions. Honestly I would beat up this assh\*le would I be stronger than him, but I wasn’t.

Meanwhile the girl stood up and started running away. The guy was facing me (thanks god) and didn’t saw her running away. So I decided to win sometime for the girl and continued the conversation with the guy. Basically he went on yelling me to “f\*ck off” and I continued telling him to be respectful to the women.

So after 1-2 minutes the girl disappeared and I let the guy go. He went on.

I stayed for a while and watched - hoping he won’t find her. I guess he didn’t, tho I don’t know for sure. The guy disappeared.

Then I called police and told them everything.

They asked some questions and told me they’ll call me back.

After all of that I feel bit shitty, cuz I think I could’ve done more.

Question - how would you behave in that situation? What could’ve been done better?

i don’t know what to do about it. i’ve talked to my significant other about my thoughts but i can’t dump it all on them thinking they’ll solve it. it’s really distressing having all these thoughts with really no way to handle them.

In 2015 my 16 month old baby girl drowned at an in home daycare.  Apparently the lady was in her garden picking vegetables when my daughter climbed up the ladder of a 24' by 52"" above ground pool and fell in and the daycare worker did not notice until it was too late.  

We also found out that the lady had too many children in her care at the time and this not the first time she has done this.  The department of human services found her to be neglectful and told her she can never have a registered daycare.  We then found out that in our state of Iowa, you are not required to register your in home daycare .  This meant this lady CAN still have a daycare and was rumored to still be watching children.  Upset by these findings, we asked the district attorney if she was going to file charges and she stated she saw nothing wrong and it was just an accident.  We also found out the sheriff's office did not really do an investigation.

We contacted the state's attorney disciplinary board and was told I have to respect the decision of the county attorney.  We then reached out to senator Grassley and was told there was nothing he could do.  We did not know where else to go.

Then the medical and funeral bills came.  We had assumed her insurance would cover the cost but got denied.  We were unaware that in Iowa, in home daycares are NOT required to have insurance.  The bills were higher than what we paid for our house.  I was never a big fan of suing but if we didn't, we would have to file for bankruptcy. 

The lawsuit dragged on for over a year until we came to the point that it was hard to pay for our basic needs like food and shelter.  We were told that if we took the case to court, we would most likely end up with nothing because they would file for bankruptcy.  So we reluctantly agreed to the settlement just so we could pay for food and pay back some of the bills.  The settlement amount was 1/3 of the cost of just the medical bills.

Our family is trying to get back on our feet but to be honest, we are really struggling.  I feel so defeated and like a failure.  My life and mentality have been so warped that I now cannot tell if this is something that I should or should not complain about.  I would really appreciate others opinions and feelings on this.

[Update]: I do apologize for not being able to respond to everyone.  The responses and kind words from everyone has been overwhelming and appreciated.

I also want to apologize the post was not very clear on the advice needed.  I was not seeking legal advice as we are not looking for more lawsuits.  We also are not looking for funds because we believe others should not have to pay for a lady's neglience.

I just needed confirmation that I was not losing my sanity due to my community treating what happened to us as a 'normal' outcome without so much as blinking an eye.  Again I want to say sorry for not being clearer in the advice needed and sorry for not being able to respond to everyone right away.  Everyone's kind words and ideas brought back a spark of hope we feared would be lost forever.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!"

I hate working/my wellpaid officejob. I have a girlfriend but I am very unhappy with my (nearly nonexistent) sexlife. I feel like I was not born to be ever satisfied. I don't really see any reason to live my life.  

Hi Community,

I am 29. I smoked weed for the past 8 years more or less. I never went stoned to important dates or work, but I smoked a few joints every evening after coming home. I love my girlfriend and she loves me. We are together for nearly 2 years but the only thing I am really missing is sex... We never had that much sex.. But at least more than once per month. Now, in the past 3 months this was the maximum. I tried to speak with her about it and she told me that she feels bad for not wanting sex, but she is never in the mood for it and she don't know why... She even changed her birthcontrol 3 times, thinking this might be the reason. Nothing changed. Surely I try to respect her and don't want to push her in any way, so I never spoke again about it. We just... dont have sex anymore... and I would lie if I would tell you this doesn't affect my ego/self-esteem. Besides the sexproblem, I really never found any job which is satisfying for more than 2-3 months and feel like I will never do. Also since I'm nearly 30, most of my friends moved away, have families or making big trips around the world. I don't have close friends nearby anymore. If my Girlfriend would leave me, I would be completely alone and nobody would even notice if I exist or not for a few weeks I guess.

Since I smoked on a daily basis I could cope with the whole situation. Weed, videogames and stuff with friends were my sex-replacement. But right now, without weed, I feel irritated and emotional - partly from the withdrawal I guess, but maybe also partly because I don't have anything anymore to distract me from my unhappy sexlife and my stressful but boring ass office job... Sure I know, this might get better when I successfully went cold turkey for a few weeks or months.. But 1) I am really afraid I'm not strong enough to make it through this phase (how long is it, how much longer do I need to endure it?) 2) I am afraid that even after a few months I feel the same way since weed seems to have worked solely as a distraction tool for me.

Apart from all this emotional/selfloathing drama going on, my mother tried to kill herself a few weeks a go and my sister messaged me yesterday telling me she went to the E.R because she had a terrible panic attack because of all the trauma.

I don't think anyone can help me, because I brought my self in this position by my excessive weed-consumption. But I need to talk it off my chest:

I don't feel important. I don't feel desirable. I don't feel strong or useful... and somehow I don't know how to exist happily without my daily weed consumption. I really don't know how things should change that I feel happiness. Maybe I'm  overreacting and I don't want to sound depressed, but I don't really see a reason why it is important for anyone that I live for 20-30 more years."

I'm a 14 year old boy, and for about 6 years now, I've had a really troubled, but close freind. Let's call her Sonia. Sonia's 15 years old, and is currently in therapy for anxiety and small outbursts of violent behavior. She was kicked out of her specialized high school due to a repeated set of ""joke"" threats she made to her classmates. 

I in no way mean to give you the wrong impression of her. She's a pretty nice kid, with a good heart and a strong mind. Her biggest problem is not being able to separate fantasies, be it the ones in her screens or the ones in her mind from reality. 

Over the past few months, she's gotten a lot less mentally stable, or so her parents say. She says she's overwhelmed with work, which I completely understand, and has lost almost all connection with her online freinds, after cussing them out. 

Through all of this, I try to be her freind, to help her through any of this, but I do have a problem. I think she might be faking panic attacks to see me.

Panic attacks are nothing new for her. She's has an anxiety disorder, and is very easily overwhelmed. But it feels as if I'm the person who constantly has to ""fix"" the problem. From even five years ago, I seemed to calm down Sonia. We both tend to create worlds in our minds to escape whatever personal problems we have, and when ever she got stressed, her parents would call and beg for me to come over, and, for a while, it helped. 

But now, however many years later, she's gotten too clever for her parents. She seems to know her way around them like they're her own house. And pretty recently, whenever I say I'm busy, whenever I've told her I absolutely can't do anything, her parents call and say she's having a panic attack, or broken down crying, and It's my responsibility to help fix it. Yet, whenever I get there, she seems completely fine, and keeps me there for hours on end, when I have other responsibilities to attend to. 

I understand that I'm young, and relatively lucky as to not be born with an anxiety disorder, and as such shouldn't jump to any sorts of these conclusions, but after cycles and cycles of the same thing happening, after she's lost most of her other friends, after incidents of desperately trying to break into my house while crying, I think she might be faking anxiety to get her way, and to get to see me. 

I'm not really sure what to do. I don't want to make accusations based off of something that I'm not knowledgable about, and I certainly don't want go hurt her if she really is being honest, but her constant calling for me, the constant over the phone descriptions of anxiety, the staying over for unreasonable amounts of time, it's all really starting to get to me, and I don't know how to stop it. Is she ready having all of these panic attacks, or is she just looking for my attention? If she is faking to get me over, what should I do? Any advice would really be helpful. Thank you.


Edit: I've read your advice (wow, there's a whole lot of it) and I think you guys are right. I should focus on me and my own mental safety before I try to help her. I'm planning to talk to her sometime soon about my excessive workload and the problems I have being her ""crutch"" as you guys have called it. I still plan on maintaining what friendship, but I do plan on telling her that I might just take a break for my sanity. 

Really though, thank you guys. For being basically my first post on Reddit, I've gotten way more support and advice than I thought I would. Thank you to everyone who helped me, it's so nice to think that I have so many people behind me. Thank you guys!"

I (21,F) have always had a hard time building and maintaining friendships. When I was younger I used to be very shy and insecure and when I finally got rid of that I still didn’t manage to make any real friends. A lot of times I do get along well with people, but they still don’t seem to have any interest in befriending me or oftentimes even forget who I am if we meet again a while later. Is anyone else in their twenties and doesn’t have any friends at all?  
I don’t know what I am doing wrong. I am in a loving relationship and am very close to my family - so clearly I’m not completely incompetent in having relationships. I just feel so incredibly lonely and hurt, whenever I see friend groups together or my boyfriend goes out to see his friends multiple times a week (which is great and I am happy for him, of course). 
Also, i feel like my lack of friendships has turned into some sort of trauma and destroys my self esteem. I get increasingly shy and awkward around people because I “don’t want to mess it up” and sometimes I question every single thing I say because I don’t want to come across as weird and I want someone to like me so badly. 
And don’t get me wrong - I am for sure an introvert and need my alone time. I enjoy doing things by myself but also there’s a limit of how much I can take. 

So I guess my question is, if anyone else feels this way and how you cope? Any tips on how to turn acquaintances into friends? "

My dad commit suicide 2 months ago and ever since, my mum has been treating me (M13) and my sister (F18) poorly, I don't blame her because she has gone through a lot and I know she just needs to take it out on someone, we don't mind so we are just trying to look through it and be supportive, I have turned to my friends, they all know what happened and their parents have all explicitly expressed how they should act around me. I have known them for ages and we always give eachother a hard time and we are all ok with that, but now, with what happened with my dad, and what is happening with my mum, I need a break from it, I am treating them badly and I know I am being more of a dickhead than usual, I am not treating them well, I am taking the piss, and making fun of them like normal, then they all start treating me like shit aswell, which is understandable because how could a group of 13  yr old boys know how to react in this situation? I am just pissed because they keep removing me from group chats and taking the piss and have slowly stopped being around me, they are cutting me out of their lives and don't realise that I can't help being a dick, I need to take it out on someone, they keep thinking I am just a shit friend, the group has pretty much closed up without me, I am not in any of my group chats, they don't talk to me and they are all cunts. I know I am being a cunt but I can't help that but they should understand that, even though it is unreasonable to expect them to know. It's pretty much an endless cycle and I have lost my dad, I'm losing my friends, I'm having a hard time with my mum and sister because they have also been through this and I don't know what to do.

Edit: wow guys thanks for all of the support and replies, I have read them all even if I haven't replied to all of them, thanks for taking time out of your day to do that, I will try some of these but some things should be noted:
I am on a waiting list for counselling, it could be a while, I am on the list for both my school one and a charity one, I am seeing family therapy for me and my mum.

I have tried talking to friends, here is a message I sent to one:

Sorry if I was being a dick yesterday, I've not been dealing with everything that well and ever since my dad died, I've taken everything very personally since, which is probably why I reacted the way I did. I didn't get any sleep and I've felt shit  the whole week so I am sorry if I was a dick.

He apologized and said he reacted badly as well, but continued that way a couple days after,

People saying that I have control over my actions and I should stop being a dick, it's not all black and white, it's not that simple, when someone is in grief, high levels of tedrinacoticotrophin (sorry for spelling) are released in your brain, making you completely different, I have anger which I subconsciously take out on those close to me, I'm sorry but it's not as simple as ""stopping"" 

Also, sorry if my mum came off worse than I intended, she is great and has been very supportive and made a comfortable environment for me and my sister, it is only on occasion that she lashes out.

Last point, I can't tell you how many times I have gone to notes, tried to write an apology and not gotten past their names, I don't have the strength to write an apology, I would really appreciate a suggestion of how to tell them that I'm sorry and I need support without sounding like a twat

Edit 2: thank you Kelsie for the silver! you guys are amazing, I have sent a message to an old group chat I found with all of them, it is compiled with bits from multiple suggestions:

I have been lashing out lately due to everything that has happened within my family. I can't guarantee it won't happen again, but it is just because I am having a hard time processing my grief. I'm hopefully going to be going to counseling soon and I hope that will help some;
losing my dad changed me and I'm sure you've all noticed I've been acting different. I really need my friends right now. Please call me out if I'm being a dick at all and I'll do my best to address it and change

Edit 3: it worked! I can't thank you guys enough, they understood and are going to try to be better around me, thanks so much!"

My husband (35) and I (33) became friends with a lesbian couple early last year, we met in our local pub.   

Margaret (50) and Hillary (25) both suffer from mental health issues, Margaret has 5 children and 2 grandchildren that she is not allowed to see due to her issues and on going violence between M and H.  It is also worth noting that Margaret lost a baby boy due to health complications. 

My husband and I had been trying to conceive for over 2 years and M and H were aware of our struggle, even offering surrogacy at one point. 

Fast forward to now and I am 4 months pregnant and we couldn't be happier about it, except I have major concerns about Margaret's ""excitement"" and I am deeply worried she sees my unborn child as a replacement for her deceased baby.  

Here's some of the things that make me worried;

1 - insisted on buying things for the baby that my husband and I wanted to get, no big deal but she got extremely angry when we tried to politely decline.

2 - constantly asks me how ""her"" baby is whilst trying to rub my tummy.

3 - I referred to the baby as him in passing (we don't know the gender) and she grabbed my coat demanding to know if the baby was indeed a boy.

And this is the reason I am really worried:

4 - my husband and I are looking to move from our one bed property before the baby arrives.  Margaret suggested that the baby live with them if we haven't moved.

I'm a first time mom so I'm probably just being ultra sensitive but I am genuinely worried that Margaret is looking to replace her deceased baby with mine.

How do I calm myself down or ask Margaret to kindly back off? 

Thanks for any advice!

Edit; thank you for all of your comments and advice it's really appreciated, I have read them all tried to reply to everyone, if I've missed you it's not intentional.

To confirm, our baby will never be alone with them, at all, ever!  We have taken all your comments in and will start to removing ourselves and minimize contact.  Thank you again!"

I have since moved to Texas. I am essentially alone and want to give myself the best chance at ""starting over"" in a new place. What tips do you have? Like the title says, I have lost a lot. I wish that were a joke. Here is some background story as quick and dirty as I can get it. Skip ahead if you wish. 

[BACKSTORY]... Keeping it as short as I can. In 2017, I had to put down my childhood cat of 10 years, then 30 days later, I found my mom dead from a sudden heart attack at the relatively young age of 54, and this was 10 days before her birthday. It was now me and my two sisters, and I was the new head of the house, trying my best to keep things together. 

I handled my mom's affairs and all that came with her passing. It was unbelievably difficult. Our dog passed in our home around 5 months later from a violent seizure. My little sister was a drug addict and my older sister was mentally disabled. It was decided that my older sister should not be around that and went to live with a relative on her father's side. 

Then me and my little sister cut ties after she lost us our jobs and stole from me constantly while I was in college trying to finish my degree. We could no longer sustain the household and were forced to move. I went to stay long term with a friend and she went with her also drug addicted boyfriend. [END BACKSTORY] 

[THE SITUATION] My family is very, very distant is all but non-existant. No bad blood there, it's just simply how it is. So, I only have my best friend right now who I owe the past 9 months to. Without her, I don't even want to think about what would have happened. I do have other friends, but it's hard to say if they would have been as supportive when it came to brass tacks.

Fast forward from Nov, 2018 when I moved to now. I am in a new state, living with my friend's family in an awkward (at least for me) pseudo-adopted standing. I am 27 mind you. My best friend is starting a graduate program and moving into a one bedroom apartment close to college. 

I will stay with her family until I get on my feet. For me, that means joining the Air Force and continuing into a graduate program more or less debt-free in the future. It's all rather complicated, but I will stop here and get to the point. 

[NOW/THE POINT]... I am in Texas. I want to make friends, connections, and make a life out here. I am not the most organized person and would like advice on how to reach my end goal of coming from essentially rock bottom to gradually becoming stable in all aspects of life in a new area. 

Things like effective means of job hunting, task management, relationships, planning, finances, finding resources, useful apps and websites to aid my efforts, etc. Really ANY useful things on ANY day to day aspect/topic that have helped you in some meaningful way, it most likely applies to me at least a little. I am starting from scratch, so I'd love to hear whatever tidbits of advice you can offer! It all helps. Thank you so much in advance!"

I have no privacy, barely no friends left, I sleep 3 hours a night because of her panic attacks. I have no energy to make her happy, I constantly screw up and make her feel even worse. 

I am not happy. Insecurity, anger issues, exhaustion, erratic behaviour is part of my personality now. After 3 years I can't be in this relationship anymore, but if I leave her she will will kill herself. 

Even though I am miserable and don't love her anymore I still care deeply for her. 

What should I do?


Edit: Thank you all for your advice. I will definitely leave her, but I will wait till January to do it. 

Her parents are aware of her mental health as she has been this way for the majority of her life. She has seen dozens of psychologists before she even meet me,  with no success. I got her on anti depressants 1.5 years ago which only made her worse. I've taken her to the hospital because she overdosed on prescription pills, and more recently I motivated her to see a private psychologist who she now plan to quit seeing because she isn't getting any help.

I have tried breaking up with her before which only made her try to jump of the balcony.  I am not a sociopath so I stayed, i can't live with the fact that I am responsible for someone's death , or that I could have prevented it. 

Now she has trust issues and I have to prove myself to her to gain her trust again, which I know is manipulation. I am aware I am being manipulated, but I really believe she will kill herself and that's why I have stayed this long. 

I will let my parents know tonight that I'm going to break up with her, and later I will speak to her parents and get them prepared.  It's going to be tough for everyone, and I really do she gets better.

Years ago, I got canned.

My boss was a nice person, but a crummy boss. He kept stringing me along for years, promising me promotions and pay raises that never came before eventually firing me. I wasted years of my life in that dead-end job because my boss made sure I never realized it was a dead-end job.

I had a lot of time on my hands after getting canned, and I started my own business. It's been growing and growing, and last month alone I made over $100k. This year I'm projecting about $1-1.5m in income. At my old job, I made about 40k.

For literal years I have been wanting to send my old boss an email showing how successful I've become, but I've stopped myself because I know it's petty and vindictive. But still, I just can't suppress the desire. I just crave that last ""fuck you"" moment to the guy who lied to my face for years. I write the email every couple of months but delete it because I feel like it would make me a shitty person.

What do I do?

EDIT: Advice seems to pretty strongly be ""Don't do it,"" so I'll slightly amend my question:

How do I let go of this desire to get back at my boss, and move on with my life?

EDIT 2: Reading all of these answers from people telling me to move on was helpful. Read a lot of techniques to achieve that. Thanks, that was helpful. I also made a post on r/unsentletters, which honestly helped more than I thought it would. I think my main strategy at this point was to try to think of it as a happy accident / galvanizing event. The timing was perfect, and it created a lot of negative emotion. Anger is a hell of a motivator, and I needed a lot of motivation in those early days.

Clarifying info:

* The boss didn't own his company. He was just middle management and I was one of his underlings.
* My job is something in advertising, but I won't share what it is b/c a lot of people are encouraging anonymity with something like this."

What do I do? My partner of 3 years said she was staying at her friends on the weekend which is fine because she always stays there. She has been weird with me since she got back. Today I was tidying up  and picked up her handbag the wrong way and everything dropped out onto the floor and an emergency contraceptive packet (empty) fell out. 

I’m literally losing my mind. 

What should I do? Is there any other reason for taking this pill? Any other reason that someone might take it? 

Edit for clarification - I found a receipt dated 2nd of June and We have not slept together recently. 

The only reasons I can think of now is either 

A) - she has cheated (which would genuinely really surprise me because she has never shown any signs like that)

B) She has been assaulted in some way (she hasn’t said anything to me at but has acted strange the last few days) 

Update : she is on her way home now. 

Update 2 : She came home and admitted that she had unprotected sex with someone on Saturday. She didn’t seem to care or regret it and somehow flipped it onto me for various terrible justifications. At the end of the day she should of just left me. I feel sick and can’t stop thinking about it. Her friend then turned up and continued to say she’s a human and she can do what’s she wants etc etc.

I’m beyond devastated and tried to be adult and calm but sadly I couldn’t and now I’ve fucked off because she is refusing to leave the flat. I feel completely betrayed and just want her to leave me alone now. 

Thanks for the support guys and thanks for the optimism to get me throughout the day. 

Final update - It’s the next morning now. She left while I was out last night, don’t know where she is and I don’t know when she will be back. I have removed her from my social media and moved my stuff into the main bedroom for now. 

I have woken up today slightly hungover (I never drink but hit it hard last night) but definitely more clearheaded about the whole situation. It still feels like a bad dream and I don’t quite know what I’m doing with myself or what I’ll do in the next few days (as I should be at work) but I either want her gone. For ever. Or I will find a way out of here, I just have nowhere to go currently and don’t have a huge amount to pay for deposits. 

Just want to say thank you to everyone who has been amazing with advice and messaged with support. I’ve never been through anything like this and have never posted on reddit and I can’t explain how much it helped me deal with the situation.

First of all, I am in Germany. When you live in Germany in a house with multiple apartments, chances are you are obliged to clean the steps in front of your door every 2 weeks. 

I used to be able to do it, but after my second spine surgery december 2018 I am unable to. For a while I had a person help me, but she ghosted me 2 months ago. 

Since then my neighbor, who is a 60-something passiv-aggressive and entitled widow, is onto me. 

She did make drama because of the steps before, for example when I was in danger of being quadriplegic and had surgery to make me walk again. She harassed my mother (who took care of my cat) and actually tried to get into my apartment. She also did complain several times about things she accused me of doing, but which I did NOT do. Such as certain noise or leaving doors open so shady people can come into the house(????). So basically, every few weeks since I live here, there's some drama with Misses Karen. 

Well, now since christmas, she's started war on me. First it was a passive-aggressive Post-It note on my door. Right after Christmas she went to our landlady. I had a call the day before New year's Eve from my landlady that the neighbor was in her office complaining about me. 

I explained that I am physically unable to clean the steps. I am not allowed to lift heavy, and I have no feeling in part of my leg, it's literally a tripping hazard for me. I also have chronic pain in the scarred damaged area in my lower back, and it's literally dangerous to bend or lift, because any time my destroyed disc may slip again into my nerve canal, again making me partly quadriplegic, again having surgery. And my doctors warned me that either I'm super careful, or it happens again and then I'll have to get screws in my spine to stiffen that area. 

I also have several chronic illnesses and chronic pain in my joints and muscles. 

So yeah, I told my landlady all this and that I'm already trying to find a helper again, who can clean the steps for me, but I just hadn't found one yet. She said it was alright, I should just keep trying. 

Soon after, neighbor was complaining at the landlady's office again. And right after I asked my mom to clean the steps so at least it's done and I can keep searching for a helper, I got a letter from the landlady that I have to take care of this issue. 

Funny thing is though, that Karen does not clean the steps regularly herself. Since she started her little war since christmas, she hasn't done anything herself! She said she has knee pain sometimes. Knee pain! Does anybody see the irony here?

I'm honestly getting crazy, I'm getting paranoid, Im afraid of her, I'm having panic attacks and anxiety. I'm thinking about moving out. But I have to find a solution to this. I still haven't found a helper.

It's probably unlikely, but does anybody have an idea what I can do? Am I the asshole? I just don't know anymore. 

Edit: Mom can't do this regularly, she has a crazy work schedule and chronic issues herself, including eczema in her hand palms which get worse when she touches chemicals or gloves etc. She got new painful blisters after helping me and I feel like the worst daughter in the world."

At most we kissed twice and then she basically chose her ex over me and I didn’t talk to her for a while but this past 6 months or so we started occasionally talking. I added her back in snap and ig. Last night I’m guessing at around 2am i received a Snapchat to our group chat which only included one other girl. I didn’t open it till now 11:30 and it was of her fucking the guy she chose over me. I tried calling her and she didn’t pickup but she texted saying “Hey....im so sorry. That was an accident. I don’t even wanna answer your call..so embarrassing. “ 
Idc that much I mean it stings a little but wtf do I even say? I mean she could’ve called or texted letting me know not to open it she was obviously awake because I think she unfriended me on snap, so she had plenty of time to warn me. Why would she wait until after I opened it and called her to say anything

Update: sorry i didn’t make it clear, the video looked like the guy was taking it so maybe the guy did send it, in terms of sending it to the closest person at the top of your recent list on snap, that group chat definitely was not recent. So they had to either mass send it or he scrolled down and send it to the group idk what he knows about me 
It was a video not a picture and I don’t want that karma of having saved it and sending it to her parents. 
I am no longer in love with her haven’t been for a long long time , i realized that she’s an horrible human who doesn’t know what she wants other than attention must make her feel good. 
I only recently started to talk to her again a few months ago because of the off chance that I could hit it and quit it which might’ve been a possibility seeing how low she’s fallen lol (don’t want to anymore I have my interests elsewhere now) 
Thanks for all the advice guys, she did me the favor of blocking us and she said she put it on airplane mode to try and have it not sent but obviously that didn’t work. I will no longer be in contact with her and honestly I’m glad I can move on from this rather quickly."

Hello this is more of a “am I acting entitled if I do this” thing? I guess.

I recently started working out in a fitness center close to me. I really like and it takes about 40 minutes. I’m not sure if it’s called circle training in English as well? 

In this center there’s a small cafe area that kind of overlooks the work out area. It’s all pretty small. There’s often free snacks and water in the cafe area. 

I’ve felt uncomfortable a few times now. I often change in the small stall which resembles a changing room from clothing stores a lot. When I walk out I’ve experienced men (one at a time) sitting in the cafe area and quite obviously staring at my ass. I usually try to think “okay, I’m wearing leggings, my butt looks good right now, just ignore it.” These men are 40-60 years old btw. I’m 19.

But when they’re literally sitting with their hands folded behind their head as they watch me work out for 30-40 minutes? That makes me super uncomfortable. They don’t even work out, they’re not supposed to be there. I feel really vulnerable while working out and I don’t think I’m the only one.

I shrugged this off as me having bad experiences with men before this and therefore being sensitive to it. But then I worked out in another center (same brand) and found out they have a woman circle. I found this a little extreme, since I don’t mind working out WITH them. I just don’t wanna put on a “show.”

An older lady told me it was to make women feel more comfortable and no other reason. I guess some women feel intimated by the really big guys.

Can I suggest to one of the workers that they put up a foldable wall (if you know what I mean?) in between the work out area and the cafe? Or should I try and bring it to their attention that some people go there just to eat the snacks and stare?

(It happens in the evening so no one is working while they do it).

Update:
Thank you for all the advice and encouraging comments! As of right now, I will continue working out at the same gym. However, if I catch a man staring or I feel uncomfortable, I’ll take a picture of the person. But since it’s rarely the same guy, I will also speak to an employee about the matter and show them the picture.

I’ll try to bring a friend as much as possible and I call my dad every time I have to walk home (if it’s dark) so I feel safer.

I realize that the gym probably can’t just change the behavior of the men or successfully stop it from happening. And it happens at a lot of different gyms. So I focus on protecting myself while still taking care of my body! :) you guys gave me a lot of good advice on how to do this, so thank you so much! I really appreciate it"

I need help. 

For context, I’m a 20-year-old female living in a small flat with my family. I have recently noticed that when I sleep, my 14-year-old brother has been poking around and  touching me /down there/. 

I have called him out on this and I have told my mother. He denied ever doing it, and claimed to have been getting something underneath me (from the bed I was sleeping in). I am 100% sure he is touching me. When my mom questioned me he immediately started crying (as though guilty). Because I had no proof to show, my mom made a compromise that he is not to go near me when I am sleeping anymore. 

It stopped for a while. However, recently while my parents are overseas, I have caught him doing it again while I was taking a nap, and even taking photos of me down there. I said “what are you doing?!” Half asleep, and he stormed off. I told my mom and she told me she’ll talk to him (I don’t think she did) and she made someone sleep over. 

I have a year and a half more to go in university, and I plan to move out immediately right after. My current game plan is to just wait it out since we’re moving into a new place that guarantees me my own bedroom. 

However, whenever I look back at what he’s been doing, I feel sick, angry and immensely violated. Our relationship is really strained and I never talk to him unless necessary (we never had a relationship at all to begin with). I’m personally concerned both for my well-being (and womanhood) but also for him and his views on sex and women. On a personal note, I have also noticed that the trauma has caused me to lose my sexual drive. 

EDIT: 

Thank you, everyone for the kind, reassuring words and useful advice. 

I would just like to add a few bits of information that may help you with my situation.

1) On “My brother and I have little to no relationship”. I was born in another country after my parents emigrated to Singapore, and my parents decided to move back to our country of origin (the Philippines) when I was six to start a new business. My mom gave birth to my brother there. They decided to let me stay in Singapore with my extended family because I had been doing well with school and got scholarships from the Singaporean government. Hence, I didn’t have much interaction with my brother for six years. When we started living under the same roof, we had no mutual interests and we were both pretty aloof. 

2) On my family situation: Generally, we are not a lovey-dovey family, and as much as I’d like to deny it, we are rather transactional. Most of our interactions when I was a child were in the form of quiet family dinners, or talking about necessities such as school, or you know, chores. I choose to stay because I remain dependent on my parents financially, but if I could, I would’ve moved the fuck out years ago. 

In our family, there is little to no confrontation; and when issues do arise, they explode and shit goes down. I think this is characteristic of a lot of Asian families (though I do not wish to generalize). This has gone to the extent of me having anxiety attacks when I need to talk to my parents about personal issues beyond needs such as asking for money. Whenever it happens, I burst into tears.  I know that this is unbecoming of a healthy family system and that in order for me to overcome my ordeal I need to get rid of this culture, but I am telling you for context to make you aware of why I find speaking with my parents difficult. 

3) I am back in the Philippines now. Seeing as a lot of your comments are on reporting to the police, law enforcement here is shit and the police force, generally oppressive. This is why my first choice seems to be asking my parents for help and/or choosing to wait it out. 

4) I have thought of installing a hidden camera to show my parents proof. However, I am scared of how they may react. You see, our culture (especially among the older generations) is still pretty backwards. Although I don’t wish to accuse my country of repudiating progressive ideas, the awareness for Western movements to end rape culture such as #MeToo are mostly for the young, educated and privileged. 

Anyway, I am aware that what I mentioned has a lot of cultural nuances (and most of you come from another side of the world), but rest assured I appreciate any more advice you throw my way. I’m also attaching them because you may find it interesting.

Not because I have anything to hide, but because my entire life (ex boyfriends and my mum) have had my passwords to my social media accounts and they’ve kept an eye on everything I’ve done. 

My FB and discord messages are full of people who tell me very personal things going on in their lives, and I don’t want to ruin their trust because my boyfriend has gone snooping. 

My ex had access to all of my social media and he still accused me of cheating despite him being able to see everything. 

I personally have never requested an ex boyfriends password to anything because I know people boundaries exist, people are entitled to their privacy and if I’m concerned about something I talk to them. 

After explaining this to him he responded with “you’re less likely to chat up other guys if I have your passwords knowing I can look at any time and see”. 

Am I being unreasonable? Or am I at least entitled to a little privacy during this relationship?

Update- I’ve let him know he needs to leave and we need to end things. I’m hoping it goes smoothly but I’m going to assume it won’t. I appreciate all the responses. I’ve read all of them &lt;3

Update 2- I didn’t break up with him based on this alone, I see how that looks, there were other things that had happened yesterday that factored into my decision."

I don't believe I'm gay and I'm just so confused about everything right now. Has anyone experienced anything similar? How do I react to this? So I've been friends with my best friend for almost 10 years now. (I'm 22, he's 21) It's quite crazy how many things we have in common, we could literally do anything together because we love all the same things. Our families know each other super well, and we do spend a fair amount of time together, just doing typical guy stuff. Being that we get along so well together, we always would see each other more often than your typical friends, I would say. Around a year ago though, my best friend found himself a girl, which is now his girlfriend. It was the first serious relationship of his life, and for some reason it made me so jealous. It didn't help that this girl had some serious manipulative tendencies and many other reasons that people didn't like her, but that's a story for another time... \*EDIT: Got some requests to explain, so I tell some stories in the comments for those interested in knowing why she is not accepted not only by myself but by our entire group. The only person to ever ruin the dynamic of our entire group, for the 7-8 years we've all known each other, and she did so within weeks of knowing her\*

Anyways, I didn't like her, at all. Maybe it was because she was changing my best friend, maybe it was because I wasn't used to having him share his life with someone else. I had gotten so used to the way that things had been for almost 10 years that I did not take to this change very easily. But why? Shouldn't I be happy that my best friend is happy with someone else? I definitely feel this way with my other friends who have significant others, just not with my best friend... And it did create tons of tension because his girlfriend didn't like me either. Anyways, things are better now in that regard, he keeps her and his friends separate (no one else likes her either) and he spends time with us whenever he can.

I still feel so jealous though whenever he's with her. I am pretty protective of him, and when he had first starting seeing his girlfriend, I would get so upset at whenever she would make him sad for whatever reason. I do feel similar feelings with other friends, but things seem so much more intense with him. And I realized that it might actually be because I might love the guy...

For me, I've never been attracted to a guy in the past. I've had girlfriends, seen a few girls, and even today find myself attracted to girls and I am trying to get back into the dating game after being out of it for a couple years now. The idea of being attracted to another guy doesn't appeal to me at all. I can appreciate how good looking some guys are, but that's pretty much it. But for some reason, I'm so freakin attached to my best friend. And it's not really sexually, despite sometimes having the urge to cuddle when sharing the same bed, for example, but that's the most that it gets. I just wanna have fun with the guy, laugh, go to bars, restaurants, basketball and hockey games, just spend time doing what we both love.

I have no idea what to do. I know the guy loves me but not more than a friend . I don't know if I even want him to love me like that because I don't even know if I love him like that. I would never try anything because I don't even know if that's what I want, and I know that it would ruin our friendship. Hypothetically speaking, if he were to try something, I don't know that I would say no... But I also feel uncomfortable just thinking about it as well. I'm so confused. I think I might love his companionship, or maybe I love him, I don't know... But the idea of being attracted to guys turns me off. Maybe it's the fact that I haven't been in a real relationship in a few years so I just need anyone by my side, and right now he's the person I'm closest to, I don't know. I just have no clue what to make of all of this.

TL;DR! - I'm super close to my best friend of 10 years. I started to get super jealous once he got his first real girlfriend and realized that it might be because I'm in love with him. However, I have never been attracted to any other guy and even the idea of being with another man is a turn-off for me, and find myself searching for a girlfriend and feeling attracted to women. I don't know if it's just because I'm lonely, or what.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Tons of people have asked me what this girl did lol I tell a couple stories in the comments. Be judges for yourselves, but you'll understand why whilst jealousy is a factor, I'd be much more okay if he was with someone else.

EDIT2: Damn, I never expected this to get THIS big... Thank you all for your input

Super long post. 

I'm Indian.

To cut a long story short, I was supposed to get married to my long term boyfriend this November. This was against the wishes of his family &amp; with not-so-happy blessings of my family.

I met his parents &amp; extended family (along with my extended family and my parents) yesterday. He had been reiterating his decision to marry me despite the threat of being excommunicated from his community till yesterday morning. In front of his family and mine he blindsided me and said he has changed his mind.

There were no flags till the day before. So it hit me out of the blue. We have booked a venue, I have bought a traditional green sari to wear in the wedding. We were looking at houses to rent. This July, he moved thousands of miles from his city to mine to be together. 

I have no idea what just happened to me yesterday afternoon. I'm still absorbing this and the consequences of it.

Obviously I'm in the process of informing my friends and parents that this is a no go, and cancelling all the arrangements.

My parents and friends are by my side. I have blocked him on all social media and deleted all our messages on WhatsApp - I need space to think and given my tendency to self pity I knew I would wake up in the middle of the night and cry over our messages.

I hate being pathetic like this.

I need advice to rebuild my life and my new reality. Anything would help really.

Edit -

Thanks everyone for your kind words and your helpful advice.

Today is day 3 of reset. He was my go-to person for everything - whenever I see something funny or crack a joke or see something he might be interested in, my mind jumps to him and i have to tell myself that no he is not in your life anymore.

I have decided these things to cope with this and have made a time line for myself -

1. Swimming
I commute about an hour an half one way to work and that is just giving me more time to stew. Have decided to go back to swimming to exhaust myself and get some exercise.


2. Journal
I used to write sporadically, but have decided to bring in discipline and write down my thoughts and feelings. I've lost my closest confidante and I have nobody to turn to but myself.


3. Wedding arrangements 
The wedding was supposed to be in November. I have a super expensive (for me) beautiful emerald green sari to mope over - I'm thinking of donating it or wearing it to some happy occasion in my family to take off the significance from it. Thousands of silkworms died to make it - least I can do for them, right.The venue management was very understanding and I'll mostly get all the deposit back. 
My parents have taken charge and are informing all the relatives, while I've informed my friends. 
I hadn't informed anyone else at work so that's something to be thankful about. 


4. Travel
Istanbul or Singapore. Solo or with family. But I won't be spending the second half of November in India, that's for certain.

Thanks guys."

I was furious and had some errands to run so I took off and wanted to vent to someone, anyone, who might share some of my indignation. So I got to a park, pulled out my phone and realized, my best friend killed himself back in March. My brother was on a boating trip and quite frankly not the best person to vent to. Another friend has been 'off-grid' for months and doesn't respond to e-mails, calls, and is completely off social media.

I'm not going to give the details of this incident because it was on the news and would be very easy to identify him and my family if I gave these details. However, his death was ruled accidental, his body was never found. The people who he was with when he died, their story has always seemed suspicious to me, never giving enough detail or avoiding speaking about it because it was ""too traumatic for them"" 

He allegedly died in a very horrific, very painful way.

Well, he's my brother, you were the last person to see him alive, you supposedly watched or heard him die, but it's too much for you to tell his own flesh and blood what happened? What his last words were? If he was in pain? If he went quickly? If he begged for his life? I don't want to sound heartless, but these guys barely knew him, they worked with him only a few months. I find it incredibly suspicious that their stories either keep changing or they absolutely will not go into ANY detail about the circumstances of his disappearance. One person says something, and another witness says another. Their time frames don't add up, their stories don't correlate. 


We had a memorial for him, and made a plaque because his body was never recovered. For months leading up to this, these men he was with were impossible to get a ahold of. They wouldn't speak on the matter, aside from their original statement to the police, but other than that they didn't speak or contact any of me or my family. They remained completely silent, and there was no getting any information from the police. We didn't know who to talk to, we weren't given a shred of help or compliance from anyone. 


Then magically, on the day of his memorial, these men showed up. They didn't speak to anyone, they didn't say any words or speeches. They hung around in the back near their trucks and refused to show any emotion or solace. Within seconds of his memorial being over, they were nowhere to be found, they were gone. My mom spoke to his ""boss"" several times on the phone, but he would always give the phone to his wife and she would speak on his behalf.

My family gets enraged with me every time I bring it up. ""He's dead, nothing will change that"" they always say, but I know in my heart there is something more going on here. I know those men know what happened to him. I _know_ they feel guilt and refuse to talk about it. The investigation into his death was a joke. No body they assumed just meant to take the witnesses stories to heart, and that's what they did. I know they know more the  they are letting on. There is a reason they feel the guilt they do. Recently, his boss just had a heart attack, his wife informed us, because of the stress and guilt he feels about my brothers death. These were her own words.

What I'm asking is basically this. Who do I call? Who do I ask to push this investigation further? There is no sign of his body, his boss never even sent us back his phone. We got his clothes and other belongings, but coincidently they lost the phone and couldn't mail it back to us, after they already supposedly had it ready to mail. There are many things off about this situation that I lose sleep every night over it. I can't escape these horrible nightmares, I know in my heart there is something hidden here.


Who do I contact? How do I pursue this? It's taking over my life. No one in my family wants to even talk about the possibility of it being anything but accidental. I don't feel that way. I know they know it too, but they are too scared to admit it, it is to painful for them to even consider. They want to believe that it was an accident but I know it wasn't. I mean, it may have been an accident but these men are hiding something deeper to protect themselves. I don't know how to investigate this further. I want to dig deeper into his disappearance and find more answers but I don't know the first steps to take. I know these men are guilty of something, and for the sake of my brother I have to know the whole truth.  I know they know exactly what happened to them, and because they refuse to give consistent answers, I feel it's far worse than I or my family even know."

She's a Latina and I'm Indian. We've decided on a Latin sperm donor, because she doesn't identify with Indians. Not sure how to feel about this, and worried about what people may think if child doesn't look like me. Firstly, the reason we're using a donor is because, I have a genetic mutation in my sperm (Y chromosome deletion) that leads to infertility. 

Either way, I was fine and I assumed she'd want to pick a donor similar ethnicity to me.

However, my ethnicity has always been a problem for her. She doesn't like India (can't say that I blame her), hates the caste system, the Indian culture of pushing people into narrow education fields, arranged marriages, the general corruption of the people etc.

She loves me, but sometimes resents the fact how people view her as she's married to an Indian. Now I'm not bad looking, I'm a bodybuilder, did modeling before, DJ, I'm a great Latin dancer (kinda how we met). But my main career is a being a data scientist and many times she says people see her as the woman who married some Indian geek. That's until they get to know me. 

An example she brings up a lot is her friend, she married a black soccer player. She says whenever her friend tells people about her husband people assume she's this cool girl who bagged the athlete, while my wife is the one who married the geek.

Of course I have a huge fucking issue and complex over this now. But I do understand, I just hate that she doesn't feel proud on her own of me. To me it sounds very immature and highschool like. 

That said, my wife is brilliant and extremely attractive. She's got an amazing body, has a high powered career, often makes more than me due to her bonus. She's very wise and mature and genuinely loves me. Hell she just spent months trying to hunt down the best breeders for a dog I've always wanted. She even made trips to see the dogs parents etc. Very very sweet of her.

She has legit told me that she hates that I'm Indian, she loves me, is very attracted to me, but doesn't like being associated with Indians. Yes it's kinda racist, but the reasons she laid out explain her prejudice is more against the culture rather than the people. She thinks Priyanka chopra is one of the most gorgeous women alive.

So naturally, she says if it wasn't me fathering her children she wouldn't want to have half Indian kids. I get that.

So the sperm donor hunt settled on a Latino men, dark skinned ones mainly.

So my question is, if I could have impregnated her, our kids wouldn't have looked Indian, but there's a high chance they would have some resemblance to me. Using a donor, the only thing they may have similar to me it's their skin complexion.

I'm worried they come out looking nothing like me and I'll have people thinking she cheated on me. Obviously to close friends and family I can just say we used a sperm donor, but again this isn't something I want everyone to know too.

And do we tell the kids when they're older? I'd hate if they realized I want their biological dad and they start resenting me."

For context, I am a 20yo female.  (TW possible sexual assault related things, though im not sure.)

On my 18th birthday my friends and I went to a male strip club as  a celebration of me becoming an adult. We were really just there for fun and laughs, like most people there that night - it wasn't anything serious. This one guy pulled me on stage and did a little dance with me, which was all fun - the crowd was hooting and laughing. Afterwards, my friends bought me a lap dance since that's the strip club 'thing'. I was totally fine with it - I thought it would be funny. I requested the guy who pulled me on stage, and he took me into a private (closed off) booth.

It was my understanding that lap-dances were a strictly no touch thing - usually for the safety of the stripper. I just thought he'd do a sexy dance over me for a few minutes, and then it'd be over and I'd go back to my fun night out with my friends. Instead, he lifted up my dress, pushed my underwear aside, and started attempting to penetrate me with his fingers.

At this point in my life, I had zero sexual experience (other than a clumsy kiss earlier in my teens) So, when he started doing this, I was totally stunned. I just remember his fingers were insistent and forceful and hurt a little bit as he tried to make his way in. I was so stunned that I didn't say anything for what felt like ages (but was probably just like 20 seconds). In a whisper, he instructed me to go outside to his van where he could fuck me properly. When I finally came to my senses I pushed him away. He backed off, and I pretty much immediately ran out of there, grabbed my friends, and cried on the street for a while.

Even though it was such a little thing that happened very quickly, it still upsets me when I think about it. It was my first real sexual experience, and as a dumb, naive girl I was pretty scared and overwhelmed. But here's the thing - I don't know if he was in the wrong here or if I'm wrong for even being upset? I didn't know what's normal and what's not in strip clubs (I still don't). Is that the regular protocol for lap dances? Are they really just code for 'lets have sex'? If that's the case, then I was sending ALL the signals for him, so is it my fault for sending the wrong message?

It's alright if you think that that's the case, I'm genuinely looking for answers. (and dw im not like looking to prosecute this guy or anything, i dont even remember his name)

If anyone read all of this, thank you for sticking this out, I appreciate it.

**TLDR:** friends bought me (f) a lap dance at a strip club for my 18th birthday. The stripper (m) fingered me without consent which really freaked me out since i had no sexual experience at the time. The incident still makes me anxious, and im wondering if what he did was wrong, or if i'm the one who fucked up by not knowing lapdance protocol."

“A” is a really great student and I rarely have trouble teaching her, she pays attention and cooperates during lessons. “B” is very different, she rarely pays attention and refuses to do work at least one time a day. As a result, “A” is much more advanced than “B”.
The parents know this, and set up a plan to do about 6 hours of lessons every day, 5 days a week. 3 hours in the morning, 2-3 hours after lunch, and another hour after dinner. “B” lost motivation a month ago and “A” is starting to lose her motivation too. The parents blame the girls tiredness and lack of motivation simply on laziness 
How can I explain this to the parents without making it look like I’m trying to do less work?

I am currently 23 weeks pregnant. I had my second ultrasound last week and was told to go to a hospital 2 hours away to have a doctor do the ultrasound again because something seemed off. 
Yesterday I went to the hospital and had the ultrasound, afterwards we had a talk with the doctor and she gave me a shitton of information and things they worry about. 
First of all she is way too small, she should be about 700 grams right now but she only is like 400. 
It looks like her kidneys are fused together into one which also worries them. 
The umbrical cord has only 2 veins instead of 3. 
And the last one I don't quite understand is that there a high resistance from my uterus and there is some backflow of the blood that goes to the baby, which means she doesn't get enough oxygen.
They told me they advice to do a amniocentesis because they think she might have trisomy 13 or 18. 
I do understand that if this is the case the chances of survival are really not high and her quality of life would basically be non existent in the case she does survive. 
But they also advised me to at least until after the results, not to do anything. So basically if she would pass tomorrow then to just let it happen. 
If the results would come in differently and she might have a bigger chance of survival they would hospitalize me and monitor her in case she needs to be delivered fast.

Now my issue us that I feel like it's just all math. When she advised me this is the hospital I didn't quite grasp what the doctor was saying yet and I agreed. But now from what I understand is that she is not getting any healthier by waiting, we would just have more information about her chances of survival. 
Maybe I'm being selfish, or I'm just not ready to give up, or maybe I'm just terrified of having to give birth to a lifeless baby. But I don't know if I made the right choice agreeing to this. 
I'm contemplating calling the doctor in the morning and ask for hospitalization anyway to give this girl every chance of survival, but I don't  know if it's the right thing to do. 
It's the middle of the night right now and both my partner and my parents in law are asleep, and I'm  not sure they would even understand these ramblings and loose strings of thought I am managing to put out there. 

Again, I don't know if this is the place, nor the time to put this here, but typing it out made me stop crying long enough to catch my breath so there is that.

[Edit: 
I'm getting alot of advice about whether to abort in case of trisomy 13/18, even though that would be a tough decision I think I have made my decision on that.
What is making things do hard for me right now is that the doctor advised us to let things happen as they do until we get the test results.
The thought of her not making it until the test results and the idea that she might be alot healthier but I just gave up on her. That's what breaks my heart."

I am so sorry that I have not updated on this matter for quite some time, as you can tell most of our ages have changed. 

I will make this brief for this hurts to talk about.

As some of you know, my parents are not astounding- and have many flaws, and when I told them about what happened for the first time they had attacked me, calling me a liar or I was overreacting.

But, after a month or two they started taking me seriously.

After a long talk, we decided to not press charges.

I know, I was upset about this too- but we cannot afford lawsuit in case we loose- and the amount of embarrassment if we were somehow proven “wrong.”

My mother has talked to the principal about the matter, and the principal is considering removing him from our high school.

But- the problem is- is that his mother has connections with the school and it isn’t that easy to expel him without angering his mother- who might sue.

Tensions are high.

The four that had watched are denying everything- and refusing to give up their phones. I’m assuming that they have already deleted the pictures, but I hope there is some way to recover them.

The school is not contacting authorities until there is proof that it happened and I’m not an attention seeker.

Thank you for reading.

So as the title says i have tremendously fucked up, I am a 20-ish-year-old Filipino, this story starts from this Monday (December 2, 2019)

So I met this woman on tinder, we matched and then we started talking I immediately started asking if we could hook up and she was starting to get okay with it, we started chatting on telegram and then we shared photos, photos that I presumed were hers.

She then started asking requests for photos of me and videos... videos that I horribly regret filming and sent, and after sending a number of them she said she was down and that we would have sex next week 

Then I started getting suspicious since yesterday she hasn't been talking which is suspicious, and so I reversed searched the images the account sent, they came from various sites as seen here: [https://imgur.com/a/dEbwer8](https://imgur.com/a/dEbwer8)
 (TO CLARIFY: They're not mine, they're the photos the scammer sent me)

Upon seeing this I promptly deleted the chat and unmatched, alongside I changed the little social media details I shared with the account.

So i wanted to ask, am i fucked? is there something i can do about the videos i feel like even though i deleted everything that the videos and photos i sent, i just hope i acted fast enough

I can chat up a girl no problem and keep the convo going. But up until now, I've always made an effort to bring up height in the convo so they aren't alarmed - it's not like I can hide it. 

Without fail, the second I tell a girl that I'm 4'10"", and that yes I'm being serious, the conversation quickly comes to a close or I get ghosted. This has happened over 20 times by now. No matter how good the convo was going, my height was a dealbreaker for every girl that I've chatted up so far. 

I had many opportunities to schedule dates and could've went on a few, letting them meet/see me in person instead of telling them my height beforehand. I didn't do this because I was concerned about the shock factor when they saw me/""duping"" girls, etc. 

Is the move to suck it up, not tell them, and just go on these first dates - risking making the girl feel uncomfortable or feel like she was bamboozled? Or do I keep telling people first, let them ghost me, and keep searching for someone who doesn't care. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

Even if this means screaming to anyone in the immediate viscinity, or threatening to commit suicide. 

It doesn't matter what it is. If he doesn't get to go to the store with mommy he breaks down in tears and starts talking about shooting himself. If he doesn't win a game of Fortnite, he tells the person to go die. It's like this every day. And, with my afore mentioned autism, i have a very big sensitivity to sound, and especially high-pitched ones like the screeches of the velocerptor i call my brother. It drives me crazy, and makes me horribly nervous/anxious. I can't stand it anymore. 

I've grown tired of this, but this isn't all he does. He does other strange things as well. He talks to himself, has conversations with people who aren't there or even inanimate objects. He sings random verses of random songs in public, and R E F U S E S to use headphones to watch videos on his phone no matter where we are, beit the store, the library or even at my place if employment. He would do something, (i;e leave a dirty plate in the living room) and then push the blame onto someone else. 





I try to tell my mother how these things effect me to no avail. She tells me not to use my brother as a reason to ""not be social with the family.""

As I'm writing this, my brother is having an argument with my step-father because he won't shut up while he watches tv.

My wife and I have an elderly day care provider named Janice, whom we like. Janice has an adult son named Mike, and Mike in turn has young children of his own. In addition to running a licensed home-based daycare, Janice watches her grandkids (Mike's kids). So, my children associate with Janice's grandkids every day.

Mike was in a contentious divorce with his kids' mother, Ellie. She's still in the picture, because she occasionally drops off/picks up their kids at the home of Janice, her ex-mother-in-law but current-daycare-provider. But relations are cold and professional. Of course, none of this is any of my business, and I like it that way.

Two days ago, we got a text from Ellie saying that her daughter wants my daughter to come to a birthday party on Feb 2. It's strange that Ellie would be texting us directly, because how did she get our number? But whatever. Cool. Yes, we respond, our daughter will see you on the Feb 2.

We mention this off-handedly to Janice. Janice becomes upset. A party on Feb 2? That's news to her! The party is on Feb 9 and they were just about to invite us! Sure enough, a few hours later, we receive an e-vite to a Feb 9 party for the same kid, at the same venue.

We discover that this isn't an error. Ellie purposely scooped Mike in creating a party. As it turns out, Ellie had gotten our phone number from Janice under the pretense that she was going to reach out to us about a play date. Neither parent is backing down. There will be two parties. My options are: 

1. attend both (a pain in the ass and an added gift expense. Give two gifts? Show my daughter a peer that is getting two parties?)
2. attend neither (it would send the right message, but it would disappoint Mike and Janice, both of whom we are friendly with)
3. Attend one party, and appear to ""choose sides.""

Keep in mind that we've already RSVPd for Ellie's party, which we did before we got wise to the BS. We have not yet responded regarding Mike's party.

What's the best approach?

EDIT: Thanks, everyone. I think we'll go to both, and I'll give the birthday girl her gift at a different time altogether, like when I see her at daycare. The party venue is an hour drive round trip, and I don't relish doing that plus the party two weekends in a row, but I guess that's parenting for ya. And I don't want to deny any kids' happiness over this nonsense."

I still, now, think she is attractive but the more I have come to view her in a romantic sense the less sexually attracted I've become to her. I don't understand it.

To make things worse the way she views sex is totally different to mine. She looks at it more as ""making love"" and will normally go slow, play romantic music, etc. Where as I prefer to act on more of a persona and distance myself from how we act on a day-to-day basis.

So, I apologize in advance for the probably unnecessary long story, I kind of feel like the details are important. 

My husband (32) his mother (76) and I (28) live in one house together, the house is sectioned off into an apartment, then the main house. My husband and I live in the apartment and mother in law lives in the main house. She is disabled and in a wheelchair from a car accident that happened about twenty years ago and has social security income, but it only covers the mortgage, so my husband and I cover all the utilities, groceries, doctors appointments and random upkeep of the house, plus whatever other expenses come along, so I generally feel as though we both contribute a good amount. We’ve been a family like this for about seven years or so, with other family members moving in and out as needed, it’s a big house and there’s always been a guest bedroom. 

So, about my husband’s cousin (44). She’s been in and out of prison since she was a teenager. Her mother (60s) is my husband’s mom’s youngest sister, and I’ve heard stories about her being abusive to her mysteriously deceased husband and both of her children, so I’m sure this girl didn’t have the best upbringing, probably didn’t get off to a good start. 
I looked at her arrest record and she’s been arrested for: 

-Prostitution 
-Unlawful taking of a motor vehicle
-Aggravated assault on a household member with a deadly weapon
-Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (again)
-Receiving or transferring stolen motor vehicle
-Burglary of a vehicle
-Use or possession of drug paraphernalia 
-Battery against a household member

During one of the gaps between her jail time, she got pregnant and did cocaine and meth throughout the pregnancy and the baby went through withdrawal and died shortly after being born. She had another daughter who was about thirteen/fourteen when she was murdered by a gunshot to the back of her head by an unknown assailant and the murder was never solved. 

So, I’ve never met her or her mother before today, just heard similar stories from different family members. The daughter was released from prison four days ago, and on the trip to pick her up from prison, my husband’s mother was invited to go, for the trip, for a reason I’m not sure of yet. To both of our surprise, both mother and daughter have been spending hours a day everyday since her release, at our house, cleaning, like really cleaning, getting down on hands and knees scrubbing floors, which, given both of their histories, doesn’t seem to add up to me, neither of them have ever been nice people. And my husband’s mother is not a family member who they are close with, they’ve never been at our holiday gatherings, never seen a card from them, like I’ve never even met them until today. So they’re a bit estranged, have never been around. 

My husband’s mother is widowed, I know that she’s lonely. My husband spends a ton of time with her when he can, we both work full time, and I try and spend time with her too. She’s gullible and definitely not as with it as she used to be. I know she likes the company, my worry is that it is more sinister in nature than she realizes. 

The second day they were here I was a bit weirded out, I remembered the stories I’d heard so I looked up the court cases against her in our state, and found everything. I looked up the obituaries from her husband and daughters. I showed my husband, and he was a bit weirded out too beforehand, but after he saw, we decided to talk to her about it, and maybe see if they had asked any invasive questions, or done anything weird. 

She mentioned that the daughter had found a leak under the kitchen sink and said that she knew a plumber who would fix it for cost of parts, and my husband’s mom said no thank you. While the three of them are together this plumber just shows up and talks and smokes with them and leaves. He showed up alone to our house yesterday and mother in law didn’t answer the door. 

This is where I try and put my foot down and say that although I think it’s very nice that her sister and goddaughter are spending time with her and helping her around the house, I suspect the are not being sincere. I tell her that I’m worried that they are doing this because they think we are made of money and want something from us. I ask if she has spent time with any other family, like her living children, since being out of prison and she says that she thinks so, but she stutters and I don’t think she really knows. I can see in her face that she is getting upset so I back off. My husband tells her how we are almost done converting the guest room into a nursery and how we really don’t feel comfortable with their behavior, and while we are happy that maybe she’s grown out of her ways, maybe she can just not spend so much time in our house, and she reluctantly agrees. I can feel the tension so I change the subject and we go home, she wants us to stop and get her cigarettes so we do. We get home and on the porch is a paper bag with some random and picked at groceries, like a loaf of bread in a bag with slices missing, some strawberries in a plastic baggy and just groceries that look like they’ve already been scavenged. I’m weirded out, my husband is weirded out, mother in law is so excited. 

He asks where she thinks they came from and she says her sister and goddaughter. The thing is, they had asked to come over earlier today, and mother in law said “no thank you, I’m getting ready to go to dinner with my son and his wife”. So she told them no, but they came by anyway and made their presence known. I run to the apartment to put our leftovers down and feed our dogs and my husband finishes getting his mother down and settled and goes to use the bathroom. I get a creepy feeling and go back to the main house to lock the back doors of the house where we have collectibles and storage stuff, basically extra storage. I go in through the kitchen door and can smell smoke and hear the chatter of women so I pause anxiously wondering what to do, I’m pretty quiet and shy, but I felt as though I had to assert myself and make sure they knew that mother in law wasn’t alone. 

So I approach this group of women in this huge ball of tobacco smoke and see their angry faces glaring at me but put on my friendliest smile and introduce myself and shake both their hands. I walk down the hall to the bathroom to get my husband and he walks out of the bathroom at the same time, I can see it in his face that something is wrong, so I slip to the side and follow him back to the living room. He asks his aunt not to say bad things about him in his house. She jumps out of her chair and starts screaming, like banshee screaming. I felt like the only thing I could do to protect my husband was to record it, so I did. I already had it in my hand so I just tried to pull up the camera and switch to record mode as fast as I could. They yelled at each other but the daughter and mother finally left. 

My husband and I talked with his mom about what happened and she was neutral at first, but became defensive pretty quickly. He suggested that they take a break from coming over, that maybe they should go out, and just not spend all their time here in our home. She immediately began repeating how she would not “kick them out” and how “they are my family” and my husband said “we’re your family too, we don’t feel comfortable with them here, do you want them here, or us?” She chose them.

My husband spent several hours talking with and trying to reason with her, but she kept repeating the same thing. He asked me to tell her my side so I did, “we are trying to start a family in this house, the nursery is almost done, I will not be around this, and absolutely will not have a baby around this” she told me that her goddaughter would never be violent or steal, and insisted that she’s a good person. She told me that she would never ask them to leave, and that she would always open the door for them.

We left. I stayed outside and walked around and played with my cat. I heard her on the phone with her sister telling her how my husband is rude and mean and how they are welcome any time, and that she hopes they visit her. 

I think we should move, but my husband very much wants to stand his ground and defend the house against them. He wants to install cameras and keep watch 24/7 and when they come he will intercept them and send them away. When he’s at work and I’m home alone, he wants me to call when they come. 

I feel like my mother in laws sister is trying to manipulate my mother in law, and just brought along her felon daughter to help. I feel like they are “cleaning” just to go through our things and scope out our possessions. Otherwise why wouldn’t it have started earlier? Why the sudden urgency of family needing to be together after never being together before? And the random plumber guy, I don’t even know. 

Sorry for the brick of text. I’m just really confused and not sure what to do."

I need some advice as to if I am being unreasonable. My husband has 2 kids with his ex, ages 14 and 18. They are great kids and have been my stepchildren for 4 years. Their mom had a substance abuse problem that took her life accidentally. She didn't have anything in her will other than some sentimental items for the children.

The exes family has no money to put towards the funeral, but they feel she deserves a good send-off. They have been contacting my husband to ask him to contribute. They feel $5-7 thousand is reasonable as she gave him 2 beautiful kids. They have just been sending bills to our house and telling him he needs to pay it. The thing is, we  have about that much saved up.

If I am being honest, I don't want to spend any of our savings on this funeral. I don't like the anxiety I get when I think of the insecurity it will cause. I am the main financial contributor and I handle the bills. It took us over a year to save $5000 and the kids are talking about colleges. My husband is helping with the kids grieving and says it is my decision if we take this on.

I am wondering if I am being heartless. I might be jaded because this woman hated me. She felt her and my husband would have eventually gotten back together if I hadn't existed. She definitely wouldn't have contributed to my funeral even though her kids can me ""mom"" too.

(suicide warning) I’m using a throwaway and trying to 
keep details vague to protect his identity.

About a year ago, life was great. I was studying hard, exercising regularly, being social and generally enjoying things.

I went round to my friend’s house one night because nobody in our friendship group had heard from him in almost 24 hours.

His housemates let me in, they told me a few hours ago he had asked to be left alone. I went up to his room and knocked to no answer, I could see the lights were on. I felt like something wasn’t right, so tried to force my way into his room.

I felt what I knew instantly to be the weight of a human body against the door. I knew he was dead before I saw him. I managed to get the door open a crack, and saw he had hung himself and his body was slumped against the door. I ran downstairs, told his housemates to call 999, ran back upstairs and forced the door fully open, his skin was blue. One housemate cut him down. The emergency services arrived, he had been dead a couple hours. I gave statements.

I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t focus on studying. I didn’t do any work for the rest of that year and I’m repeating the year now. I delved into drug addiction. Shortly after, my grandfather who I looked up to very much passed away. 

I still don’t sleep well, I’m not exercising, my diet is bad, I feel sad and alone and depressed and angry most days. I’m keeping my head above water, just, in terms of studying but I feel myself slipping under. I can’t motivate myself like I used to. I saw a therapist for a while but I’ve seen many over my life (depression, addiction, anxiety, adhd) and never found them particularly helpful. I’m 6 months sober, went cold turkey from everything of my own volition but I haven’t found it to help in any measurable way.

I’ll keep on trying but it is hard. Will things get better? I don’t know how to change my circumstances, I feel pretty powerless.

I don’t think I feel guilty, although I believe I could have helped him. I wasn’t even that close to him, not nearly as close as others in our friendship group. He wasn’t a bad person.

Sorry if i’m rambling.

As background, we are newlyweds as of March 2. Being a college student, we don't have ""real"" jobs yet and are pretty poor. I work as a waitress and he works at a grocery store.

We have to keep a pretty tight budget, which is hard for him because he was in the habit of buying drinks and snacks at gas stations or buying lunch at work instead of packing. Even though he agrees we need to stay on a budget, the bank statement showed he kept buying needless stuff out of our joint account. 

We discussed that he was having trouble controlling himself, so he agreed to let me hang on to his debit card so he will stop buying things. Then his card went missing, I learned that he stole it back without telling me. 

After that whole fiasco, I find that he has been stealing out of my ""bank"", or my cash bag I bring to work to make change for customers, also where all of my tips I've earned in a shift are. Now he is stealing from me and what I earn, not simply our joint account. I am at a loss of what to do. I don't know why he needs to buy snacks so much and why he can't control himself.

I expect a little judgement about being newlyweds so young, but I really want advice. Please help!

Edit: A lot of people are suggesting separate accounts. The thing is, we started the marriage expecting to keep our finances separate. When he couldn't save a cent and I ended up having to pay more than my share of the bills because of it, we decided to merge the accounts and let me handle all of the bills, spending, budgeting, and saving. At this point his debit card was supposed to be on him for emergencies only. 
A couple of people suggested addiction, whether to food or to spending. His mom was an addict and he does carry some of those addictive traits, so it is something I will look out for. 
I won't completely rule out substance abuse, but I highly highly doubt it. I'll keep an eye out though."

He started swearing and shouting in public. Then yesterday I was back in the airport and he decided to shout again and started saying things like “You like being shouted at in public? You got issues? People with issues get shouted at in public!” Yesterday morning I slept at 4 am because I was up with cousins hanging out. So obviously I was very tired last night so I fell asleep and woke up at 9:30 AM. He has a dumb rule where you HAVE to wake up at 9 for no good reason. I woke up and got out of bed to use the restroom. He ends up knocking on the door and I say “I’m in the restroom”. Then he says, “What time did you wake up?” I said: “I woke up 9:30 but was supposed to wake up at 9.

“9”

“Now we’ll see how your day is!” And he left. I’m currently working out and when I go up, I’m expecting more shouting and getting grounded for sleeping in half an hour later on CHRISTMAS BREAK.

**BONUS STORY:** On Saturday morning, we were in the hotel room and he asked if I’m going to brush and I said yes. I then took a shower and got my clothes on and was about to brush when he stopped me and said, “Why the fuck haven’t you brushed?” 

“I was gonna brush after showering.”

“WHO THE FUCK BRUSHES AFTER SHOWERING! Do you have a brain or is it all shit in their?!”

I’m 16 year-old gay boy that’s in the closet. My family can be tight on money but my parents have been saving up for our college savings. When my parents found out my older sister was pregnant before marriage, they decided not to pay for her college savings and kicked her out. They told her that her savings would go towards me since i’m “worthy of it”.

My dad scares me. I told him that I had a crush on a boy when I was four and he got angry. From then on he forced me to “masculine things” such as enrolling me in sports, giving me only shooter video games, preventing me from enrolling in “feminine activites” such as arts, drama, music even though I adore all three, and teaching me over and over how being gay is a sin. So twelve years later, he thinks his brainwashing works and that I’m straight cause all my friends are dudes and I don’t fit the “stereotype”.

Whatever. Now, his co-worker came out as gay, and he was very furious. He vented to my mother about it in the car, speaking about how it’s going to be the end of humanity. Basically it leaves me wondering... what if he finds out I’m gay again? Is he going to kick me out of the house and not give me my savings like what he did to my sister?

We picked her up this morning. Everything seemed fine, so we went about our day. Just now, my daughter told my wife that her friend's mother gave my daughter (and some of the other kids; some kids refused) 4 gummy ""vitamins"" that the mother claimed would help her sleep.

My daughter said it was sweet tasting like strawberry flavor. My daughter also just told us that after she ate the gummies, she got dizzy and felt like she was going to vomit. She didn't get sick. Thankfully.

My wife and I are pretty upset. I don't think I need to explain why. I have no idea what was given to my daughter. I mean it could really be gummy vitamins. Still, I feel that feeding other people's kiddos vitamins (no matter how sweet and chewy they are) is crossing a line. I also don't think vitamins would upset my daughter's stomach. The nausea thing might be an exaggeration or just in my daughter's head. Either way, it's still troubling.

My wife asked me if I was angry. I'm upset, but I'm trying to make sense of it. Then my wife asked me what we should do. I have no idea. I don't really know how to handle this. We don't know this girl's mother all that well. She goes to the same dentistry as us. This was the first time my daughter went to this friend's house.

I really don't know what to do. I don't want to make a big deal out of it if there is a simple logical explanation, something like: It was gummy candies the mother dished out to the kids, telling them it would help them sleep (but really … just candy … hoping the kids will calm down). I don't know. As a parent I feel like I should do something. I just don't know what. Please let me know how I should handle this situation. Thank you."

We had our 24th birthday just over a month ago, and going out for dessert with her and our family after dinner was the last time I ever saw her in person.

I can't look at pictures of her. I can't look at her things, or read the journals she left behind, or hear music we liked in high school together, or think about any of the good things about her because it kind of cripples me. I don't know how to come to terms with the fact that this person who knew me better than anyone else and who is so prominently featured in every single one of the memories I have of my childhood is not someone I can see or interact with again, and I keep thinking of things I want to tell her and then remembering I can't do that anymore. She has always been the closest person in the world to me and I feel like I am actually trapped in a nightmare.

I'm sad and angry and terrified, and worried beyond belief about my dad and brother and about myself. I miss her horribly, am unbearably angry at her, have so many regrets about times I didn't see her or things I wish I'd told her, and the idea that I may truly never ever see her again petrifies me. Beyond all this, I was always a twin, and sort of felt part of this exclusive and cool club of twin-ship that make me feel like we were special, and I don't feel like a twin anymore. Most of all, I just don't know how to operate without her on the earth with me.

I am going to work and seeing my friends and going to therapy weekly--just looking for stories and advice from people who understand something about this. Thank you.

I have had 20 years of bachelor lifestyle and this past weekend I married the love of my life.  My father wouldn't go to the wedding because my mother was there and my brother didn't go because he was busy.  If that is any indication of my family structure, realize where I am at.  I was dating this young lady because she is very grown for her age and knows what she wants.  I had a huge accident last year and required major reconstructive surgery.  Without a thought she quit her job, moved in and took care of me, hand and foot.  I couldn't go to the bathroom, get up, change or bathe without her.  After a lot of thinking and self reflection, I knew I had connected with a person that would always be there, always be trying and never let me go.  I don't know what a good relationship looks like but I am willing to write our story with a fresh outlook.  She comes from a really good, tight family.  Her parents are married and they have traditions, actual traditions in her family.  How does someone be a good husband?  Are there any books I can read on how to be the best I can be for her?  I told her I was interested in couples counseling to show us ways to approach problems or bring up questions we haven't thought of yet.  I heard that a famous football player does it with his wife and they said it helped even if they didn't have any issues at that time.  I just don't want to mess this up.  I have dated women from all ages, races and types.  This one put an end to a grown man boy living an irresponsible life.  I am a professional but have had no responsibility for much of my life other than my career.  Is there a good reference out there for ways to be a better man, for her?"

So when my sister was around ten years old, she was molested by my father, not her biological dad and it really fucked her up. We grew up together pretty close, since she was almost ten years older than me I idolized all and everything she did, and she did try her best to be a good sister to me despite the huge age gap. We've fallen out of touch and I've thought about reaching out to her again, and whenever I did I would get this immense tight feeling of fear in my chest and I don't know why. The reason why we weren't talking now wasn't really the cause, but all I could remember were those times where she touched me at weird times and me feeling uncomfortable. It makes me even sick to write this. When I was around 6 or 7, my sister would start making me take showers with her, and touch me and talk about my body and how it was so different than hers. More stuff happened, but the worst things happened when we were showering together. I really don't know what to do, I've only really just started thinking about it because I've left my abusive family, and Im remembering things again because I didn't before and that's how I coped. The only reason I remember an age is because I remember her being in high school. I don't know what to think. I don't know how to feel. I just feel really scared right now. If this is really true, then I don't think our relationship can be repaired, or at least I don't want to repair it. 

Tldr; my older sister used to touch me in the shower when I was 6 or 7, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. "

I need some impartial advice. **EDIT:** ***3:30pm PST***

***Thanks for all of your advice everyone.***

***The question has become moot; Brother passed away this morning.  Thank you all for your kindness.***

I was going to post this in r/AITA, but need a broader base of opinions than just 2k or so people.

Just over 3 years ago, my younger brother was diagnosed with stage 4 non-smokers lung cancer.  It had spread all over his body (we found out because he was having pain in his right shoulder and hip, which turned out to be growths pressing on his nerves).

Originally, the diagnosis was 3 to 4 months left to live, but due to gene therapy, he has lasted until now.

He has slowly been losing the battle, but he is one hell of a fighter, and we have been holding out for some therapies to make it to human trials.

A week ago, things took a sudden downturn.  He collapsed, and went into a coma.  I obviously took time off from work, and spent 2 days at his bedside... and he woke up.

He wanted Taco Bell, and I went and got his request: two crunchy tacos, a bean and cheese burrito, and a medium Sprite.

I stayed with him until the next day (taking another day off from work (I am a server lead at a semi-high end restaurant)), and he seemed almost back to his old self, or at least as much as he could in his fight.

36 or so hours ago, he respirated (breathed in) some of his oral medication, and relapsed into the semi-coma.

He is now incoherent, and is doped up on morphine.  Again, all but in a death coma.

He is not aware of anything, and when he *does* even open an eye when Mother shouts to try and get a response from him, he -at best- responds nonsensically.  He has repeated something about wishing someone a happy birthday and that he loved them three times when I was there and she did that.  Our sister's birthday is on the 23rd.

It is the end, and we all know it.

My question, my request for advice is this:

This is *not* how I want to remember my little brother.  Dying, incoherent, breath rattling in his throat, and so sunken and shriveled that my forearm is larger than his thigh.

I want to remember the man that left our parents at 17 to live with his big brother because we couldn't accept our ""Pardon me, but do you happen to have any Grey Poupon"" type parents.

I want to remember the man who would selflessly give anything of himself to any other in need.

I don't want to watch that person I knew as he dies.  If he was even the *slightest* bit awake, if he could for even the briefest second know I was there...

But that person is gone.  The cancer is in the brain, in his spine, in his lungs, and attacking his heart.  I was there until he no longer was.  I don't actually want to watch his physical body die as well.

But that same family that he left now insists that I must sit deathwatch at his bedside, and watch him breath his last breath.  The 6 hours I spent alone with him today (they all cleared out when I came in, insisting that we should be alone) was ***brutal***.

It has always been Brother and I against the world.  

But I can't do this.  I can't do this alone, watching the *one* person who has always had my back die before my eyes while I hold his hand... while he is already brain-dead.

I can't watch him choking on the mucus in his lungs that he has no strength or will to expel.

And please, no religious stuff.  I know you would mean well, but neither Brother nor I subscribed to that, despite Mother's strong Catholic beliefs.

So all that said, I need your advice:

Should I literally watch my brother die?"

Alright so this is gonna sound very weird but please bear with me.

I have had hemorrhoids for many years now. When I first got them, I would be constipated all the time, they would bleed and prolapse. They're pretty good sized I guess. But recently I haven't been complaining at all from them besides sometimes getting an itch when I walk too much or bleeding a little bit when I'm constipated.

And now I need to make them appear irritated/worse somehow. Fast.

Backstory: I'm from a country with mandatory military conscription for all males. I absolutely do not want to get drafted and would give anything to get out of it. Some people get exemptions for medical conditions; I don't know if hemorrhoids is one of these conditions, but I want them to appear worse to maximize my chances. If this gets me out, I'll get it fixed afterwards.

My appointment for the medical checkup is tomorrow, so giving myself constipation is out of the window. I'm thinking about maybe rubbing some hot sauce or chili up my butthole. Don't know if that'll do the trick.

If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears.

I know this might seem like a troll post but I swear it's completely serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: So I cut a chili pepper in half and rubbed it on my butthole and oh my lord what a dumb fucking idea that was. It feels like I was buttraped with battery acid. Would not recommend.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Just came back from the checkup. As many of you suspected, hemorrhoids are unfortunately not an exemption-worthy condition. I set my butthole on fire for no reason. Looks like I might end up serving after all. Only option right now is to leave the country and not come back until my call period is over in a couple of years. I'm thinking about it."

TLDR; the mother of my child is sleeping with a married man behind my back. We both have genital herpes and I want to warn the man's wife so that she doesn't contract an incurable STD due to her husband's infidelity.

I recently made a post regarding the fact that I had found out that my girlfriend of 3 years was sleeping with a married man behind my back. That one was asking for different advice because of her history of keeping our daughter away from me when we've had issues or broken up in the past, so I havent ended the relationship officially yet. That's been somewhat resolved, I'm working with a custody lawyer to get a joint legal custody agreement in place, which I have managed to get her to voluntarily agree to. She really doesn't have any reason not to because I actually spend more time with our daughter and provide more financial support than she does. I'm still waiting to hear back from the lawyer today and get the paperwork started, but this puts me in another uncomfortable situation that I could really use some advice on.

This man has been married for five years and has a two-year-old daughter right at my daughter's age. His wife does not know what's going on, and he told the mother of my child last night that she can feel free to text him when he's at home because his wife would have no way to get into the phone app to see what was going on between them. After the custody agreement is in place and I have broken things off with her I feel like I should reach out to this woman and let her know what her husband is doing. I will admit that part of me enjoys the idea that she would leave him for his infidelity, but this is less about revenge and more about doing the right thing. I have had herpes for 8 years and passed it on to the mother of my child 2 years ago right after our daughter was born. She knew very well the risks involved, because I have always make sure to inform all sexual partners of the fact that I have an incurable STD. I feel terrible about the fact that this poor woman could contract herpes from her husband because he's stepping out on her with the mother of my child who has herpes.

He of course does not know that she has herpes, and quite frankly I don't care to tell him, because the way I see it if he will cheat on his wife he deserves no warning from me, but his wife on the other hand didn't do anything to deserve this.

Based upon the text messages that I've seen between them I can provide enough personal details, up to and including the hotel room he's staying in for the next two weeks out of town on business, and believe that would suffice to convince her.

That being said, should I warn her once I have a custody agreement in place and end things with my girlfriend?

Edit: typo

Update: We signed the custody paperwork this morning, after which I told her I know all about everything, and that while I'm disgusted and angry and sad I don't hate her, and comforted her while she cried. She wants to talk more tonight so she'll be coming over after she gets off work. Meanwhile I have sent a message to the woman and she hsa already gotten back to me. This is not the first time he's cheated and with the screenshots I provided she believed me without a moment of doubt. She said she was going to call her gynecologist and schedule an appointment to get tested to make sure that she hasn't contracted herpes from her husband. I feel a great deal of relief after getting everything off of my chest, and fulfilling my moral obligation to warn his wife of the risk he was exposing her to."

I'm 29 years old. I've known in my mind for years that something has felt odd but Ive a been ignored by friends, family, and doctor's when I shared my concerns. I've always taken a lot of pride in being not only a good person but an unproblematic one to boot, and so I've busted my ass my entire life to fit in and not make noise. I've always struggled pretending to be and feel normal. I thought it was maybe a phase or a personality trait but no, I'm autistic. That is perhaps why I have crippling anxiety and depression. I've been fighting a disorder I haven't understood or known I had for 3 decades. I'm not fucking crazy, I'm tired...

It took me about 5 whole seconds to come to term with today's results because it's honestly freeing as fuck not having to wonder if I'm just losing my mind or not. 

I plan to and feel the need to be open about this but i have absolutely no idea how to bring this up in my personal life. Like, when the hell and how the hell do I tell my family and friends that ""suddenly"" I'm autistic? Sure most of them won't care, but that doesn't make it any less intimidating. How about my boss? I've fucked myself up mentally by trying to be a personable person  but it's been difficult and not without issue and a lot of people have mistaken my social anxiety and social fuck ups as something far more sinister. While I in no way want to use this as a crutch or an excuse, far from it, I think it's an important part of who I am and might help others better understand who I am and why I am that way. 

Is it unreasonable of me to feel relieved to know this and want to tell others? I mean fuck, it's been something I've dealt with forever and I've never got to tell a soul about it, how could I.  I just want advice because I know one of my problems is being a little too overzealous with just about everything and I can already hear/see people's reactions and it makes me want to pre-emptively crawl into a hole and say nothing. 

I just want this to go over well. Thanks"

She's very shy and even starting a conversation (which with me she does) is a though task for her. Now, don't get me wrong, I like her. She's a very person and I love hearing her viewpoint on many subjects. We talk a good amount and I think I've made it clear how good friends we are. 

I asked my best friend [17F] to help me and she told me not to tell her that I'm not interested. According to her I should just not engage her and not do anything that'd give her hope. As a person who has been led on in the past (and was in a state of not knowing whether a girl like me or not) for a good few years, I'd rather be told right away, than be taken on an emotional rollercoster...

At this point I just want to know what to do to cause as little pain to my friend as possible, but I need help to decide what to do. Will you help me? I already asked on a different sub and didn't get much insight.

TL;DR This friend likes me romantically, but I like her platonically, what should I do?"

My SO then went white as a sheet and told me they experienced something similar. We aren't too into the whole ghost scenario but are defiantly concerned maybe we need to set up security just to be safe. Someone could have been in our house- and if that's the case- there isn't one person we are close enough to living near us that would play that kind of trick on us. The problem is we are flat broke until Tuesday. Is there anything we might be able to put together from common house hold supplies? I'm sorry to say we are childless and thus lack about 75% of the shit Maculy Culkin had in Home Alone- so most of those types of ideas are out of the question. Also, no dogs live here, unfortunately.

So. I am 24(f) and I am an EXTREMELY heavy sleeper, like, very heavy. I just do not wake up. You can shake me or even have sex with me and I wouldn't even know.


So someone broke into my house (I live literally in the boondocks) without me knowing and sexually asulted, raped, whatever you want to call it.

Edit: i missed my period. Although I want to believe the discharge wasn't mind, I am still in a state of shock. Cant take a pregnancy test that will be positive until 3 weeks has passed anyway. 


Edit: it could very well been my own discharge and the person didn't eject into me. It doesn't change that I was sexually assualted in my own sleep. I just suspected it was someone elses diacharge because I missed my period...

I woke up with SPOOGE all over my vag and I was like, what the fuck is this? 


I go to the emergency room to get checked out and this hospital is literally a fucking dump. You go there to die basically. They are all dumb as bricks and have no empathy for situations like this. They refused my care and didn't believe me 

I am not on birth control and I am afraid I could become pregnant. I am thinking if I am pregnant and since the hospital denied me a rape kit, thinking about getting a lawyer and suing them for malpractice, negligence,  whatever*. Any thoughts, ideas on how to go about it? Advice besides getting a damn good lawyer? 

I am so fucked up by this and NO ONE FUCKING BELIEVES ME. My best friend of like, i don't know, 10 years didn't even believe me nor does my family.

I need some advice on how to go about this. I never been raped before."

Hi everyone, first time poster on reddit.

Up until about a year ago I knew nothing about my father, had always been just me, my sister (who has a different father) and my mother. I never even knew his name until my (now ex) girlfriend persuaded me to start looking. I found out his name from my mum and found who I thought was him on Facebook and messaged asking if he knew my mum. 

Several months passed until I received a reply from who I know now is my aunt, informing me that it was actually my grandfather and had died recently. After this I met with my aunt and discovered that she is not on speaking terms with my father and I actually have 7 aunts/uncles and that my father, one uncle and my fathers mother live on my street. About 50 meters from my house.

 Every time I leave my house or walk to the shops I can look straight into their house and see them. After finding out where they lived I realised that my childhood best friend (who stayed at this house over weekends with his gran) lived in that house, who it turned out is actually my half brother (fathers son with another woman) and that his gran was my gran too. I was never told this, or if I was I was too young too remember/understand.

 It's been about 3 months since I last spoke to my aunt, she has been messaging asking me to come and meet the rest of the family and I have ignored her due to anxiety, depression and generally not knowing how to handle the situation. 

If you made it this far thank you for reading, hopefully this isn't too confusing and I would love to hear some opinions on what you would do."

I'm 22 and left the home due to abuse Hello, I am coming to you all today out of pure desperation. I need advice with my extremely difficult situation. Please be kind and patient, thank you for your time &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;3

I have a mother who has chronic pain (7-8 joint/bone/spine related conditions) , which has supposed to have left her in a wheelchair but by grace and luck she still has the ability to walk (not for long distances at all though). She has depression and anxiety and to give context of support, she has been with men on and off and up til the last year, she was with my sister's dad who passed away to brain cancer.

I left home when I was 19-20, due to narcissistic abuse - I also came out as trans and queer prior to that which had made things extremely difficult for our relationship (abuse ensued, little to no contact but I still visited home every 2-3 months to see sister).

I am 22, living in northeast as they are in the south - I had to leave to save myself. My mental health was spiraling out of control, I had to find support as a queer person and to get away from the abuse as it was getting more and more verbally violent. My mom began threatening me with physical abuse, as she never hit me or would hit me, she sees me as a product of the devil so honestly I don't know how far she would go based on the awful things she has said.

My sister who is 9 is caught in the crossfire - I'm not sure what my mom has said to her, but my sister has a me that is older, independent and out of the home, my mom who is not taking care of her (she uses tv and her tablet as her only source of the outside world, outside of occasional meetings with my lovely grandparents at their house), and her dad/my stepdad just died last year. Which, I was not told by my mother when the funeral was, so I missed it.

I had hope, because recently my mom told the family that my sister would be online schooled this fall and... for another year in a row, she isn't. 

My mom claims that she isn't getting the help she needs in order to put her in school, as she's kept my sister out of schooling (not without family members arguing and begging to not do that) - my mom claims that the school system doesn't teach the truth, that kids are not the same anymore, it's unsafe, etc. My sister has had no social life and I'm extremely terrified of what more time isolated with my mom is going to do. Also she deals with dyslexia, which my mom isn't helping with properly. She's been at home helping my mom function on the day to day, as my mom is bedridden most of the time yet has the capacity to get basic errands ran and to be on her phone all day every day with her internet friends.

I've been called selfish for moving out to save myself and it haunts me everyday. I've established a life/career in the northeast but right now I'm thinking about dropping it all to save my sister in this mess. She's a bright angel, so smart, but she needs outside contact. Even when I was living at home, my mom would turn down my offers to take her to school.

My mom has taken total control and has sheltered my sister, while struggling with chronic pain and unstable finances - my grandparents aren't helping because they just retired and have supported my mom their entire lives. She justifies everything she does with that she doesn't have the help - although she has shut out so much of the help that society could offer out of fear and narcissism. The home stays messy.. no money... my mom is NOT teaching my sister at home in a structured way - even though she claims she is on the homeschool forms.

The last thing my sister needs is CPS getting involved... maybe I could take care of her.. but that is a large LARGE thing for me to take on and I'm scared that I'm unfit as well (just due to being young). I've supported myself, I've tried to focus on my health - and now I'm afraid that my selfishness for better or for worse is making things well.. worse. 

I love my sister to the end of the universe and back.

My mom has made it hard for me to even call them now to check in with my sister and to talk. 

What steps could I take in order to get my sister in to school? My mom won't allow any help.. Should I just drop everything and live back home to make things better? But I'm concerned of my health declining. I thought I could leave and come back and make it all better, but I've been out of the house for two years and haven't created a stable enough base to help.

 I need help. Any advice is welcome. Thank you all.

**EDIT**:: I forgot to mention that my sister has been ""homeschooled"" according to my mom and what she's told the school board.. which with any sort of structure and guidance isn't possibly happening in this situation. My mom might.. MAYBE give her a few worksheets a month but she has lied for the last few years on the homeschooling paperwork that she has been given. 

My mom is also an only child, so I don't have uncles/aunts to help.

My sister is vaccinated, she doesn't get check ups because the government not only took away my mother's disability insurance but they also took away her healthcare as well a year or so before my stepdad was diagnosed with cancer. So she can never afford to but my sister is not in any DIRE physical harm - maybe not eating as many cooked meals, mostly various fast food options but shes eating.

**Thank you for all of the responses, I'm a bit overwhelmed as I didn't expect to get this much attention.. I appreciate you all deeply, and your advice has been taken in loud and clear..**

I really want to go see my sister, check in with my grandparents, etc. before the summer is up, but I've had a hard time affording a plane ticket..if you'd like to help me with that in anyway please feel free to message me but otherwise I'm just grateful if you've even given me the time of day. Time is priceless, I'm sending everyone so much love. 

**I've never received this sort of support with my situation, I'm crying a lot today.. I appreciate everyone's part in my healing. Please check in with those around you, tell them you love them.**"

should I report him. Mobile, so sorry for formatting issues. 

Sorry my for the length on this one. 

For reference I am a 17 year old guy. My parents divorced when I was young. We lived in Waco, but after the divorce my dad moved to Dallas a couple hours away and I stayed with my mom. 

Taking care of me  and my older brother was obviously difficult for my lone mom. Especially since this was right after 9/11 so racism towards us (we are Muslims) exploded (ha ha). My mom worked many jobs with little pay and suffered a lot of discrimination. Because of this she was always hot headed and raised us in a strict fashion. 
When my dad visited he would always bring us toys and buy us fast food and be really nice to us. Of course he didn’t visit often. So in contrast to my mom, he was a lot more calm and had a sense of humor. I was young then so of course I hated my mom for yelling at me and preferred my dad for all his toys. I'm mature enough now to realize that my mom was doing all the parenting while my dad was kind of a deadbeat.

Eventually I got old enough that it wasn’t as difficult to take care of me anymore, so he started taking me t Dallas to stay with him for a weekend here and there. I even stayed an entire summer one time. This was when I was in middle school so I was probably 11 or 12 at the time. All I really did was play games and watch anime on my iPad all day when these visits would happen. He would go to work and then we’d eat out and then he’d go party and i would go back to sitting around in my iPad.

My dad was always very physically affectionate with me. He would always kiss my cheeks and stuff, but at that age it’s annoying but you kind of just deal with it. I also thought that’s just how my parents culture was. Since I was born and raised in America I really didn’t know much about our home country, though I do speak the language. His living arrangement for a while was as a roommate to one of his friends from college. That man went through a divorce and his kids all grew up so he had three bedrooms. Now you would expect that the three of us (my dad, myself, and my dads roommate) would sleep in different rooms, but my dad made me sleep in the same bed as him. I slept by my mom when I was younger but at this point I already had my own room and was accustomed to sleeping alone. I didn’t want to make him mad and take me back to my mom who yelled a lot, and I kind of just wrote off the over affection as being part of his culture so I just went with it. 

One of these visits takes a turn for the worst. All I remember is that I was sleeping in the same bed as him and I played games and watched videos on my iPad until I feel asleep. He was watching some foreign drama. When I woke up in the morning my shirt was pulled up a little bit and his hand was in my pants, touching my private parts.

When I looked at him he raised his hand and stated rubbing my stomach. I just assumed at the time that it was an accident and that he was just running my stomach out of fatherly love and accidentally went too low. Despite this, I still declined to visit him for a while. I think I was subconsciously trying to rationalize what had happened, and I didn't tell anyone. I didn't have a good relationship with my mom yet so I wouldn't feel comfortable doing so, and I was way too shy for the police.

When I was in ninth grade he remarried to a woman with two kids, one of them was the same age as me. So he invited me over (we had seen each other in between) to basically have a play date). We became friends so I started visiting more often. My dad seemed to be a responsible father. He was working at AT&amp;amp;amp;T, providing for the family. All of the things he doesn't do for me. Most importantly grew didn't seem to be showing signs of perversion near us, including the then 11-12 year old younger brother. 

Because of this I thought back to that incident. I guess he really did touch my penis on accident. I basically cleared him off all guilt in my mind.

Fast forward a while to now. A month ago I was diagnosed with cancer. Stage three Hodgkins Lymphoma to be specific. The prognosis is good and the treatment has a 99% success rate so I'm not worried smoky dying or anything. I have six months of chemo and am done with the first one.

A couple weeks after my first chemo, I develop a lot of mouth ulcers mixed with a fungal infection. The pain is incredible (9/10) and im unable to eat or drink cold drinks so im hospitalized in Dallas. My mother stays with me everyday and sleeps on the couch and my step father drives two hours here to visit me and two hours back everyday after work. At around 7 pm my stepdad gets here and at around 8 my dad gets here. At this point my dad usually stays with me while my mom and stepdad buy me dinner. It takes them anywhere between 1-2 hours to do this and they usually arrive at about 9, sometimes letter

Now for the first few days this isn't a problem. Because of the effects of the cancer my skin is really dry end itchy. The fact that I've been laying around the whole time (I'm getting 1.5 mg of morphine every hour, along with an extra 2 every 20 minutes if I choose to hit a button, though I only push it in emergency situations like if I'm in agonizing pain. The morphine still makes me really drowsy so I sleep a lot)  also makes my legs kind of weak. So my moms been rubbing oil on my back and legs and arms and has been massaging them too. My dad sees this and the nest day asks if I want him to put oil on me. I see nothing wrong with it and say ""yeah, sure."" Then he does the same with the massage.

Then one day he tried to do it without my permission. Im covered in blankets from my toes to my upper chest and laying in my hospital bed. I'm really cold so I use like three blankets. Anyways, just laying back and playing games or whatever and he asks me if I want to put oil on my legs and I say no. He comes to the right foot side of my bed (at this point it's just me and my dad). He starts touching my feet through my 3 sets of blankets and I'm a little uncomfortable. He starts lifting the blankets and I say no a little bit louder, and he says ok and goes and washes the oil off of his hands. Then he comes back and starts lifting the massage and I say ""I don't want the oil"" and he says ""this isn't oil this is a massage."" 

I get mad at this point because he's saying all this and not even looking at me while saying it, he's just looking at my feet. Im usually pretty docile and quiet but when I get angry I can raise my voice just fine. I use a voice that's loud enough to startle him but not loud enough to make the nurses check in on us and cause a serious incident. I yell ""NO, DON'T TOUCH ME,"" causing him to let go of my blankets and look at me with wide eyes like I'm the bad guy. Then he says ""okay,"" and shots back down on the chair on the other side of the room.

I choose not to tell my parents about this because they do it too, though they ask me first, and would probably just call it a misunderstanding.

Another day we're in a similar situation, just me and him in the room while my mom and step dad get dinner. At some point I wanted to send a picture to my friend to show them that I had shaved my head. I start using my iPhone 8 selfie camera and the photo isn't coming out the way I wanted it to. I remember that my dad had the new iPhone X which had for front facing portrait camera. So I ask to use and take my selfie. I go to the photos app and I send the picture to my phone.

While I'm in the photos app he goes to the bathroom and I use that as an excuse to snoop through his pictures. I find pictures of me asleep in my hospital bed. Now I'm thinking that he probably thought they were endearing and posted them on Facebook but I still think it's creepy. So I confront him about it by asking why he takes pictures of me while asleep. He couldn't seem to find the problem with it. I raise Mt voice and say something along the lines of ""Just don't fucking do it,"" and he says ""okay.""

Later, I'm covered head to toe in blanket just because I'm most comfortable in that position, and I hear the sound of a camera shutter followed by the sound of a phone hitting the ground. I throw the blankets of my head and chest and ask him with anger, ""What the fuck are you taking pictures for huh?"" He says it's a screenshot and that I was covered up so there's nothing he would've taken a picture of anyways. So I get all comfy and covered up again. Then he makes this condescending, dickish remark like ""What, are you afraid of pictures now or something."" I don't know  if it was the morphine making me emotional or if I was just really insulted but I shed a few tears.

I have been thinking about telling my mother and step father about these things since I don't really want to see my father ever again, but things attempt quite that simple. We don't have insurance. There is no way we can afford to pay for all of this treatment on our own. Since I'm basically living in Dallas now, my dad was able to file something under a ""major life change it to be able to get me in his insurance plan by April. The quotes in that phrase don't signal skepticism btw, I just don't know the exact phrasing. My parents were discussing it with him and they looked content during the discussion. If I tell my parents or the police, my dad would probably take it away.

Besides that, the cancer and chemo had taken a physical toll on me, but they are also affected by it. My mom is a forensic and had a stroke the week before I was diagnosed, not to mention that she tends to me all day everyday. This situation has been very stressful for her and I don't want to add anymore. My stepfather drives for four hours a day every to see me and bring me things and I know that can't be easy.

I'm just planning on waiting the 6 months of my chemo so that my cancer is cured and maybe a little more so that my parents' stress is relieved. 

The only problem with that is that I turn 18 in June and i don't know if that changes things legally.

**TL;DR**

I'm like 70% sure my dad is a pedophile and don't know if I should report him because my parents are stressed out due to my cancer and we need my dads insurance to be able to pay for the expensive cancer treatment.

What do I do?

**EDIT**

One very good point someone made is that I may have confirmation bias and be explaining the situations in a way that makes it seem like they support my theory. 

I have taken some all actions since this post, mainly because of suggestions by you guys, and would like to share then with you.

1. I have told the nurses not to allow him into my room, but I indicated that it is because he talks a lot and refuses to stop when I tell him that it gives me a headache. I didn't want to report this to the police due to the insurance issue. 

2. I told the older stepbrother about the situation and we both agreed not to lose it further until I finish my chemo. That will not be the case if he catches my dad doing something to ho him or his little brothers. I told him that if that happens, he shouldn't need anyone's blessing but he had mine to call his mom and the police."

My father did his worst to me and my mom last Thursday by telling us that he took illegal loan money from the people he usually gambles with. We argued over it... my mother and I kicked him out of the house as this is not the first time he does this. 
Thing is, the people he took money from are asking for it back and since they don't know where my father is they are coming to our house. Apparently it has been over a year of him not paying back 1800€

They are getting quite aggressive and say they will be coming tomorrow morning to our house to get the money. I only have 500€ saved up and my mother 600€. We already are in a lot of debt to banks and are in the red on those sides. We can't take loans anymore as none of us are able to pay back. I thought of asking my best friends who know my situation or family but they all look at me like I am beggar. They change the subject and avoid it before I can ask them for help.

I'm panicking and I thought of going to the police but my mother begs me not to. I don't know what to do until tomorrow morning to get the money... please help me. Any advice, any word of wisdom, any sort of help is welcome.

I was talking to one of my friends today about relationships, and I'm in one. They aren't, and I was asking them what their type was. They went on to say they wouldn't date a POC, because ""they just aren't my type"". Is this offensive? I've seen this said by other people in regards to, say, someone who is trans or bisexual or another orientation.

I don't understand why this would be offensive, so I guess I'm looking for an explanation as to how this could be taken the wrong way? I don't think having a ""type"" is seen as being racist or transphobic or not being inclusive. You're not drawn to people with that ethnicity/race/gender/orientation. It's not a big deal, but apparently it is? Like, I'm into guys who happen to be engineering majors, or have beards. How is that different from saying you're not attracted to a trans person or a black person?

Sorry if this sounds SUPER naive, which I can understand why. Can someone help me with this so if I have another interaction like this, I can handle it or respond to it properly?

When we moved to a neighborhood from an apartment we were so excited our daughter could make friends who were more likely to stick around. Well the friends have stuck around but they are a disappointment. All my daughter wanted was to have good friends who love to play. Every kid is obsessed with technology. None of them have a unique personality either. Its some internet persona from tik tok or youtubers they idol. They have absolutely no imagination. Mean and negative constantly calling everything and everyone ugly and and stupid. Always screaming. They hit bit and push on occasion. Trashing her room and my house no matter how much i try they just dont pick up unless i say something, then they do it. Im sick of having to tell them. The few sleepovers weve done they say theyre bored, miss their phones, and leave. Theyve even said yes lets have a sleepover tonight!! She gets so excited! And then they change their minds ""just cause"". So im done with sleepovers so she can stop getting her heart broken. She has a very sensitive heart and needs a meaningful connection that somehow these kids dont seem to need? To make matters worse, we switched schools and the vibe here is completely different, not in a good way.

These arent assumptions of them either. I have these kids over 24/7 and have gotten to know them each personally. I was basically a free babysitter this summer feeding them and attempting to teach them to be better people. But it isnt getting better and my daughter is starting to think everyone hates her. Shes frustrated and lonely. She feels used. Its almost like they only play because they are bored. Not because they like her. But she is the type to do anything just to have a friend. I am also home all the time so we spend so much time together. Not as much anymore obviously, shes very bored without a friend her age with us nowdays. I just want to see her happy but im not sure if i should let her cut it off herself with a bit more convincing on my part. Or if i should be the barrier between her and them, no choice, and basically tell them why. 
The kids are ages 6 7 7 9 10. 
Im fed up with internet raising kids. It makes me sick. Im lucky to have a daughter who somehow doesn't like it that much. But its been a struggle finding someone like her."

I was in touch with the lost and found employees of the airport and the frontier lost and found.  On OCT 04 of this month I get a notification from Apple stating that the laptop was connected to the internet at a specific time and located the Laptop to a Frontier Airlines Hangar located couple of miles away from the main terminal.  I have sent the images that apple provided me. Initially, I was able to get in contact with frontier lost and found staff but after locating the laptop to their facility they have become dodgy and will not answer back my phone calls. I have talked to the Airport police but they cannot do anything because it is a large building.

Fellow redditors, am  I screwed ? I am a PhD student and have like 4 years worth of documents saved on that laptop. Yes i have about 75% of them backed up to cloud but the most recent ones are all in that laptop.

UPDATE1- I have finally decided to post it to twitter and would like to get some input about the tweet  and the corresponding pics  from you folks....

 @FlyFrontier  I have misplaced my  laptop at frontier terminal as I was making my way back home aftermath of Hurricane Florence. The Find My MAC feature notified me that it located the laptop at a Frontier Hangar. Lost and found claims they haven't found anything. I'm worried it might be stolen by someone in the office. 

Here are the pictures

Update 3 : Again before I even say anything, I can’t express enough gratitude to everyone who encouraged me to keep on pursuing the matter and also go up to corporate. 
Now saying that, I emailed one of the higher ups at corporate and explained them my situation and sent them the pictures on Saturday. 
By 9am CT Monday I got a phone call from Frontier Baggage Service stating that they are actively investigating and that they admit responsibility for the loss of the laptop.  They emailed me a claims form to fill out so that in case they can’t locate my laptop we can come to some sort of settlement.


Now I ask you guys, how do I get a fairly compensated for my laptop if they don’t locate it ? (Before I go any further, I want to say I just want what is mine. I don’t want to make a profit or get something out of this). I was doing some research and Airlines usually take depreciation into account and make an “appropriate” settlement.  To give you guys some details I literally got that laptop 1 month and 16 days before this unfortunate incident. It is a brand new 2018 Macbook Pro and I just used it for watching lectures and doing schoolwork.
Again thank you all so much for  your help!!

My boyfriend(23) and I(21) are temporarily staying with my aunt(54). She’s always easily been one of my favorite family members. When I first realized that I’m pregnant, she was the first person I told and she immediately offered to let us stay with her to save up money and move to a bigger, better home. Of course I took her up on the offer. I figured it would be nice to help my aunt around the house, while giving myself the space to take a bit of time off of work in preparation for baby. It was okay at first… But now I have a few people in my family (my father and grandmother included) telling me that I should get out of here asap. “You need to find somewhere safe,” my mom told me. Keep in mind that she has literally dropped me as a newborn and has poisoned me on a HANDFUL of occasions.

I’m not too sure how else to explain this chain of events so I’ll list it all.

1. She told me that if she prayed hard enough, I’d miscarry. She told me this with a smile on her face.
2. She keeps filling up bags of cat litter and leaving them around the house… Like directly in front of our bedroom door, despite the fact that my BF has told her he can handle the litter and I can be nowhere near the cats litter due to risk of toxoplasmosis.
3. She’s asked me repeatedly if I could just give up my son for adoption, while also telling me how badly she’d love to adopt because she couldn’t have kids.
4. I’m almost 100% sure she’s started abusing her cat… And the cat screams all night long. So BF and I are getting no sleep. Aunt does not care. She’s told us both that she doesn’t think it’s fair that we get a full night of sleep if she isn’t.
5. She moved the litter box into my room, near the head of our bed. BF moved it and told her that toxoplasmosis is bad for me and baby, but she keeps trying to move it back. Somehow the place it’s in now is inconvenient for her.
6. I’ve clearly told her on multiple occasions that burning sage could cause miscarriage or early delivery. She hot boxes the house with it. Not like smudging… She literally hot boxes the entire fucking house with sage smoke. “If that baby is meant to be in this world, he’ll come no matter what.” Those are her exact words.
7. When BF isn’t around, she’ll randomly comment on my appearance. “You look like shit” “You look exhausted, wow.” “Ugh your tits are sooooo big.” “You look so much like your mother, it’s scary” (Mind you, I look nothing like my meth head mother), “you look absolutely horrible”, etc.
8. She is constantly talking about my BFs “energetic overlay” and how she needs to clear his energy out of her bedroom every night because his energy is affecting her so deeply that she’s dreaming for him and processing our childhood trauma for us, which is causing her to lose sleep.
9. I went to the hospital for a check up, and she (very forcefully) tried telling the doctor to make her my emergency contact.”I mean, nobody else would come for you”. As soon as she left the room, the dr. asked me if my home situation is unsafe at all. Every time I see the dr. she asks me if we’ve left my aunts yet.
10. I feel the need to literally hide my stomach from her. When she walks in the room, she glares at my stomach. Like she hates my baby. Or she hates the fact that I’m pregnant. The other day she said “wow, you’re actually pregnant, look at that.” Mind you, I’m 6 months along now and have been showing very clearly for some time.
11. Her cat pisses on everything. Including (especially) my things. My aunt seems to think it’s cute and if I’m upset about it, I’m clearly not ready for a child because “babies are much worse than my cat”. (She’s never had kids and her cat is the worst animal I have ever been around. Also, BF works with cats and dogs so he is fully aware of the fact that her cats behavior is not normal. In her eyes, “Mo is doing that because she is a spiritual being and she is clearly picking up on something in another realm”. Also, again, toxoplasmosis is a huge issue and concern for me… And nobody wants to clean another grown persons cats piss off of their things multiple times every fucking day.
12. AND FINALLY, she told us when I was about 2 months along that she’d be moving out of the apartment and signing the lease over to us so that she could move to this cabin with her friend. So we stopped looking for a place and put all of our focus into saving money and trying to make sure we have everything for when the baby comes… She randomly texted me the other day saying “I found an apartment for you” and is now expressing how we need to be gone by the end of the month. If any of you know the Bay Area, it’s practically impossible to find a place within a few weeks. No matter how much money you have. The link she sent me is for a place in one of the worst possible neighborhoods you could possibly live in out here and when I told her I was willing to move, but not there, she fully freaked out and now won’t speak to me. One of the very last things she said to me was that we should just give up our son for adoption.

We (BF and I) are not financially unstable. We both work full time, pay all of our bills and we are both fully healthy. Our relationship is and always has been easy going, straight-forward and honest. Living here has caused a handful of issues and I don’t know what to do anymore. We are currently looking to move still and I don’t want to be fucked up to my own family… But I want her nowhere around my child at any point in his life. Should I talk to her about it? Or just sneak/move out when she’s at work one day? Am I stressing for no reason?

TLDR; Aunt is doing a bunch of weird and harmful shit to me and my boyfriend and idk what to do.

Edit: For those asking, no she hasn’t always been like this. Also when I said she’s poisoned me, I was referring to the fact that I have a severe allergic reaction  to cashews and pistachios and she’s managed to make/bring me food containing one or the other at least once a year.

**Update**: After posting the original, my boyfriend and I talked and thought things through. We wanted to leave in the easiest, least messy way possible. My mom offered Bf and I a room in her home and made it very clear that she wants to be present for us and the baby, and wants to make sure I’m stress-free. We set up a day and time for us to move into my moms, while my aunt was at work… Just to avoid any potential drama. I packed up all of our things over the course of 3 days. Bf and I kept our heads down and tried our best to stay out of her way.

On the second day of me packing our belongings, she got physical with me. She accused bf and I of abusing and starving her cat (I was like ??????????), before screaming in my face to “Just leave”. I told her okay, stood up to walk out of the room and she shoved me as hard as she could. Thankfully, I was able to catch myself on the doorframe and yelled at her not to put hands on me. I pulled my phone out of my pocket, I said something about telling our family how she was behaving, and she tried to snatch it out of my hand. I am not too sure what came over me, but I looked her in her eyes and firmly told her, “You need to back the fuck up, I am not going to jail today.” She stormed off and left the house for the day. She didn’t speak to us at all during the rest of our stay. I blocked her on everything and honestly cut off a chunk of my family the day we left. 

Bf and I are now in a safe, healthy environment. We are both happy and stress free. Our son is due in 10 weeks as of today. We took the cat and she is loving her new home. Thank you guys for giving me the push I needed to stand up for us."

Yesterday I got a call from my relative, who told me my father was found dead. Me (22 yo) and my sister (25yo) are the closest relatives. We live in Europe, but outside United Kingdom. My  father lived in Scotland, however as far as I know he didn't have citizenship. My mom was in legal separation with him for the last ~15 years. We still haven't got an official information about his death. My questions are: 

1. How can we find out what to do next? Can we collect his body for a funeral, or do we have to wait for somebody to inform us?

2. The cause of death was probably a suicide. In this case, is it possible the body is still under investigation? Could this be why nobody contacted us yet? 

3. He had a car. What do we do with his belongings? 

4. It looks like me and my sister will be financially responsible for everything, but we don't have much money. Is there any kind of financial support we could be eligible for? 

If anyone has any experience or knowledge in this field, I would be very grateful for advice.

Dear redditors,

Since last year my 14 years old son literally  changed. From one day to another he just went absent psychologically. At first, I thought it was normal as a teen to feel a little ""sad"" sometimes, and in fact I was reassured by what I thought since after a week he seemed ""normal"" to me, but then one day I was shocked by a call I received by the school he goes; they asked me if my son was sick since he didn't go to school for almost two weeks. I felt.. like a failure as a parent? What kind of a mom doesn't know his son wasn't going to school? I, then proceded to call him and picked him up. He had a mental breakdown, explaining that kids in school bullied him all the time. He changed school. The school was great but he was still ""off"". Fast forward, he now is in therapy and he still has ups and downs. He got diagnosed with TD (teen depression) and GAD. Yesterday, his therapist suggested me that he could take antidepressants. I was a little weirded out by it because my son did very significant progress (or at least I think), and he even told me that was my son asking him antidepressants (it's been almost a year in therapy, and he got very along with his therapist).

I’ll try to compress five years of ups and downs into something short. If I leave anything unclear, just ask. My girlfriend has been toxic since we met. It wasn’t a big deal throughout high school since I thought we would both mature and come to an understanding. Recently, we’ve been living together for two years and are attending the same college. She’s graduating this week and I still have two years left. She wants me to buy a $10,000 USD ring and propose to her by December, something I am not on board with at all. I’m not ready to commit to someone before I’m even out of college. There are a few things making it complicated for me to break up with her. Firstly, we have an apartment leased together until next summer, and I know she’ll be stubborn and insist she gets the apartment to herself despite us making equal payments. It’s two bedroom, but i don’t think still living together would happen. Second, I’m trying to finish school and I don’t want to have to move home (about an hour away) and have to transfer *and* get a new job. I live paycheck to paycheck, but moving home might alleviate some of the burden. Finally, we’ve had small breakups in the past that have left me depressed to the point of physical sickness. I haven’t made a lot of mental health progress since the last time and I don’t think I’m healthy enough to not have problems this time. I have to break up with her, but I don’t know how I’ll get myself out of this situation. Thanks in advance

TL;DR: I’m at the point where I need to leave my girlfriend, but I don’t know where I’d live or how to overcome my emotions."

We are 99% sure that her termination was justified and she was instructed to make amends and move on and find new employment.  My wife even patronized this place a few days after the termination for a scheduled appointment.  She was there for over 4 hours and the topic was never brought up which was fine with her.  To complicate matters worse, she has even hired the person for an upcoming wedding for the older daughter.
Today, my receives a text from her former boss asking if daughter is working for a direct competitor.  IMO, this is not appropriate and further more no longer any of their business since their relationship was terminated.  Everyone involved should move on.

(19 M) Not gonna lie, this post kinda hypocritical since I've helped quite a lot on this subreddit while still struggling myself. Anyways, I've been wanting to lose weight for over 2 years now. I started working out and dieting many times but ultimately failed every attempt. For various reasons I couldn't really stick to it, I was never consistant about it. The longest I've worked out was 2 months.

I got two problems: sticking to workout and eating less. I really need to eat a lot to satisfy my hunger. What I thought of is gradually decrease portions but since I stopped working out I forgot about it as well. I mostly did cardio (1 hour on treadmill) but then I started some strength training as well. As i said, due to various reasons (mostly being me finding excuses) i always quit working out and usually gained all the way back.

I need motivation, I gotta stop being lazy, I know what I have to do to achieve my goal, I know what's best for me but I don;t realise it. I'm a lazy person in general and I think that also plays a huge part in all this.

Any kind of advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I normally am very cautious and did everything i could to verify that she was real (she was real, a real scumbag). One thing led to another and we ended up doing some NSFW stuff. I didn’t know she recorded me and then proceeded to blackmail me. I’m dumb, i thought she wasn’t a scammer but i fell for it. I panicked and paid(i know dumb) and everyone knows what happens next. she asked for more money to not post the photos to facebook. The facebook i used with her was a very old one (made to play iphone games when i was 10) so i don’t really have anyone on it. But still, i am lost. i don’t know what to do. I cant take it. I blocked her on everything and deleted the facebook page. Whatever happens with the content she recorded happens. But i am terrified. I am so stressed out and can’t stop crying anytime i think of it. I hope it all blows by but i don’t think it will. i don’t want this to be known to the people in my life. I don’t know who to talk to, there’s no one i can in my life right now so i guess i’m turning to reddit. please can anyone help, any ideas how to take my mind off it? is there anything else i can do in this situation? honestly i’m at the end of my rope so any feedback is good feedback. 


TLDR: I was STUPID and got blackmailed, now there is explicit content of me somewhere. I blocked the blackmailer. I’m at my wits end, i don’t know how to deal with this. Any advice appreciated. 

EDIT: I just woke up to all these comments and i want to say thank you to everyone. Seriously thank you so much. 

UPDATE: I contacted my local police with the little evidence I had (A few screenshots of our chat) and learned there’s not much we can do. The person lied about their location, I am not great with computers so i never got a hold of an IP address to give them or anything. I knew as soon as i fell for it that there was a high chance the scammer wouldn’t face any legal repercussions. I am already very inactive on social media so i’m going to just keep laying low. Reading through all these comments has given me a chance to take a step back and really look at this with some clarity.  Here is where I am at with the situation. 

This shit happened, there’s nothing else i can do now, the best thing for me is to keep moving on. These scammers run on irrational emotional responses, I’ve blocked them on everything and at this point there’s no logical reason for me to dwell on this anymore. 

Once again i want to say thank you to everyone here. This is my first reddit post and all of these responses truly are helping immensely. For anyone wondering if i learned my lesson about scammers the answer is yes."

Should I continue if she continues her”job”? So it’s fucking weird; we met at a kink shop.    I [m30] went with one of my Best friends [35f].   We’ve been friends since high school, never hooked up, but she’s into some light fetishized, hates going alone, so I tagged along.    (I usually act like
Her boyfriend to ward off guys). 

Anywho I was just looking at some masks....they had the American Horror Story Leather getup and I was fan boying out.   Taking pics for IG and Snap; then this fuxking angel of a women passes by and says “why don’t you hop in, let’s take it for a ride”. 

I’m an introvert(ish).  So I basically got Stone hard, giggled like a school girl, and couldn’t sum up the correct words to form a response....she was well aware of it....and said “I’m just kidding, don’t cum in your pants.” 

We got to talking, exchanged Social media....and after a few weeks of me...just liking away at every post and photo, like some creep who has nothing better to do.... she asks if I want to grab coffee.   

We grab coffee, then dinner at a Mexican joint, then we go to a small French style pastry shop...then we end up at her place.   What should’ve taken 30min, turned into (sincerely) the best 6 hours of my entire life.   I grew so close to her in those hours, hanging on her every response, her cheesy smile and slight overbite.  The way she’s reach over and touch my forearm when she laughed at my incredibly corny jokes and what not.   I didn’t want the night to end.  And I found out she didn’t want to either. 

When we got to her place... I wanted to just kiss her on the cheek and leave... because I know how shit I am at sex... unless I smoke a joint, then I can go on for quite a while.  She invites me in...and I begin to have an inner anxiety attack; on the outside... I’m fine, but the inside, I’m panicking.  

When we enter, her apartment has a Japanese vibe to it.  He has those tall 5 section shade separating her living room from her dining area, there’s hand painted mountains and cherry blossoms everywhere, and at her lamp/desk, there it is... my “Mario Star!”, an ounce of weed (legal here) and an array of smoking apparatuses.     She sees my delight and tells me to pick my poison.  

As I smoke, she excuses herself; and like an idiot, I get up and walk around her apartment.   I follow the myriad of art pieces hanging in the living room that hang around the walls of her tiny hall.   Again... like an idiot... I follow, until they end at her door.   She’s on the phone, I’m trying to get high, but all I remember in that moment was her saying “I have to cancel”.   I didn’t think anything of it.   

A few minutes later, I’m high, and she comes out in a kimono and chop sticks holding up her hair.   I don’t remember what I said, but it warranted a chuckle from her, and ungowning.   Possibly the best sex I’d ever had; that night.  

A few weeks go by and we see each other everyday.   She’s busy at nights, but free at all times during the day.    On the 5th week.... she told me that she wanted to talk... I won’t trouble you with my insecurities.    We met up; she broke the news that she’s a PRO... and that she intends to continue to do so as it’s a “great way” of making money.  I asked questions; she considered us to be more than friends and that she wants a relationship with me. 

Like an idiot.  I tell her no; especially if she’s a PRO.    She cries; not in the manipulative way; I’ve been there, her cries were sincere.    I told her I’d need to think about it.  

This happened on friday, and every hour, she texts me with a heart.    I’m so fucking lost.  I really love this girl.  I haven’t said it, I can tell she’s waiting for it.  But never have I ever felt this way about anyone.   Never.  


Facts she spit to me. 

1). Everything is covered.  No bare anything 

2) she sees only a few “regulars” and that’s it. 

3) she gets checked every 3weeks.   Never an STD (she brought all her paperwork for the last 5 years).  Never a pregnancy.    Etc. etc. 


I love her.  I know she loves me.  But should I have to put up with other men she’s ducking sleeping with?  Should I make a stand / ultimatum?

Got her pregnant.  We got married.  Had another child.  But the whole time I was catching her sexting, calling guys for hours while I worked, saying she loves them, it started online on this thing called IMVU until she banged my friend in real life which is when I moved out.  

I kept forgiving her because my dream was the to be a husband and father.   Until it broke me.  Literally broke me.  The last 6 months living with her, all.i did was lay in bed.  Sleep.  Became a potato.   

When I finally moved out, she moved a dude in from.another state she never met in person, only met in imvu, and this full out destroyed me mentally. 

ANYWAYS. I'm now 29, going on 5 years of being single. Rebuilt my life.   But I still feel this thing in my brain.

I feel like I still have no personality after this happened.  I used to be fun and witty and now I'm more serious and quiet and am alone every chance I get.  

I've tried dating. But usually one of us ends up ghosting the other.   I justify not dating by thinking, Do you really want to have to add an adult human in your life? The drama.  The baggage.  Nahh.  Just be single and read books all day.   

I just, have nothing to say anymore.  I dont like to go.on dates because I'm in my head so much.  My head is always thinking about deep stuff.  But I never have anything to say.   

Me on dating sites is - hey, hows life? That's cool.  

Me in dates ""small talk small talk silence"" 

I just dont get it. Before kids.  I could even date anyone I wanted.  People loved me.  But now.  I cant even have good conversations.  

So I end up never going on dates.   Instead I end up finding someone  who is also broken, we get our emotional fix for a couple months until we mutually ghost each other.  And usually it's a situation where we cant see each other.  (The amount of times a girl has said she wants to get tickets to fly out to me is astounding) 

The whole situation with my ex broke my brain.  And it coming up on 5 years, is finally getting to me.  

What can I do? How can I get out of my head? How do I get a personality back? Is this who I am now? The quiet deep thinker who doesnt go out? Am.i destined for just these short online interactions for my love life? 

Anyone have this happen and escaped? Or is this just who I am now?

Welp.  Let's see how my first reddit post goes.

EDIT: maybe my wording sucks.  But I'm over what happened.  And am not sad.  Or anything.  It's more of a, I lack personality, or at least compared to what I used to have.  I suck at conversing.  I'm the guy who can sit quietly staring into nature for hours.  Without saying much of anything.  If that makes sense."

I spoke with my girlfriend and she is all in and loyal about doing it and moving out ASAP (talk about a keeper) I am going to put down my application and deposit soon and we are looking to be out by August 21st (soonest date) we calculated our expenses and cost of living and I would still be saving $700 a month so I wouldn't be broke except on a big budget (This is for food, gas, insurance, phone, etc..) my question here is do you think it is selfish of me to move out because I don't want to live at a house where I get no privacy, constantly people walking in, stuff going missing that I bought, stuff of mine being thrown away because my mom thinks it's trash. Or should I just suck it up, help out my mom and stay home? Keep in mind I would be splitting costs and our apartment is $813 a month (Cheaper than living at home) I am not wanting to have a bad relationship with my mom but my dad thinks I should do it and go.. looking for a second opinion. Thank you

TLDR - Mom is now demanding $500 to live at home, if I get my own place it would be cheaper, mom would cut me off and is telling me my ideas are stupid.

END - Thank you all very much for the help in this situation, my girlfriends parents are going to help a lot and provide us with old furniture they have, and even help us move out when the time comes. Her side of the family really loves her and I and we both agreed that we are ready for this challenge! Today we will be going in to sign our lease and hopefully be moved out by August/September for whatever is available first. I haven't really told my mom yet but that will be for later. In the end it's not about the money but more of being independent and as some of you explained taking the last step into manhood. I know we will do okay :) Thank you all!"

Being a family man that is available to my family? Or a wealthy man that provides everything for them?  
I am 28 years old and have an absolutely beautiful and charismatic wife with two amazing children (2&amp;3). I prioritize being a husband and father above all else, which is why I work so hard to provide for them. 

I am currently a Sr Mgr at a large corporation and am rumored to be offered the Chief Operations Officer position within the next 2-3 weeks. I worked my way through the ranks with this company and can confidently say that I would be a kick ass COO and have a fully developed vision for the company.

The dilemma that I am currently faced with is; if I continue down my current professional course, that I will not be able to be the man that my wife and kids need? I will be traveling a lot and preoccupied when available, but on the other hand, I will provide a lifestyle where my family will want for nothing. 

When organizing my thoughts and writing them down, I guess it becomes a lot easier to decipher and understand...

Edit: Thank you everyone for the advise, my wife and I are tracking this very closely and reading every comment. We were both shocked to see how many people have recommended both as optional and focused on providing suggestions on how to maintain both a career and strong family dynamics."

I made this account just for the sake of asking this.

So my friend, my best friend, lied to me as a ""test"" on a drastic scale.

She's female, I'm male, for clarification, and I'm about a year younger than her, and we're (or we were, I guess) just friends. We're both in middle school, but we go to different schools. We've been friends for about 5 years. This is all just for context.

We're texting, and out of the blue, she sends me a picture of her hand covered in what she claims is blood. I ask her about it, and after asking enough, she tells me she stabbed a girl, and she might be dead. I ask about it more and I'm generally skeptical about the whole thing, despite her being generally open about being visibly psychologically damaged.

Eventually, she asks the question. Quote:

*You wouldn't betray me...would you?*

However, since I'm internally freaking out, I don't notice that this reads a little dodgy. I responded with

*""I don't know if I should.""*

*""That might not be the best course of action \[on my end\]""*.

She flips out. Come to find out, she was ""testing our friendship"" and the blood was actually just red dye. She told me that she felt betrayed, and I tried to explain that she lied to me and that this isn't how you test the strength of a friendship. I told her she was blatantly trying to manipulate me. She then said I was playing the victim. This back and forth ""me trying to explain to her why you can't test a friendship this way"" and ""her claiming I betrayed her"" goes on for a little bit. Then she tells me to leave her alone. I had tried to remedy the situation by apologizing, but by that time she'd blocked me.

What do I do at this point?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit \[July 6\]: Thanks for all the recommendations on what to do- I've blocked her back at the moment, but she technically has more methods of contacting me, so if she did actually want to fix things she could easily just contact me through other means. I have completely lost trust in this girl, so if we did become ""friends"" again, I probably wouldn't believe a word she says; Though, at this point, I suspect it was to get rid of our friendship looking in retrospect. Especially since we had an argument last time we talked. I think I'll just let it be at the moment since I've already blocked her. Seems to be popular opinion anyways. Thanks for the advice, Reddit!"

How to go about this? So this might be a bit dumb compared to some other situations people on here write in about, but here goes...I have had my cat for 5 years and we used to have a really close bond until my roommate of 2 years moved in.

Basically she treats my cat like she’s her own cat and gushes over her all the time, giving her her own little nick names and hogging her in her room. At first I thought it was nice that she liked my cat so much, but I feel it has gotten excessive. 

Unfortunately my cat has absolutely no interest in me anymore and spends all her time with my housemate (sleeping in her room all the time and following her around the house). My housemate really encourages this and my other housemate commented that she thinks this is quite inappropriate, considering that she is my cat and that she would be pretty pissed off in my position. We also recently moved into a bigger house with a garden and I said that I would like to make my cat an outdoor cat because she would be happier and the housemate said she didn’t think this is a good idea, which really irked me.

I spoke to my house mate about this in an assertive and non confrontational manner and she stated that she knows it is wrong and other friends and family have told her this, but she can’t help it because she loves my cat so much and that my cat scratches at her door all the time (this is not really true because I notice heropening the door when she hears her walk past). She also went on to say that she is so grateful for how generous I am with sharing her. I told her that I appreciate this, but I need her to hold back from now on and to withhold from encouraging my cats behaviour until I feel we are bonding again, but she has done nothing since our discussion and the behaviour is continuing.

I feel pretty annoyed at the moment and that my house mate is being pretty inconsiderate.

What could be a way to approach this with her from here?"

I asked this in AITA but it's relationship advice technically so the thread got locked.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 17 and just graduated high school. About a week ago I found out I was pregnant, and I know for a fact that the father is my boyfriend, who is currently a high school junior, because I haven't been with anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

We've used a condom every single time we've had sex, so I'm not really sure how far along I am. My last period was in early March, but my periods are very irregular so it's very hard to go off of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my mom the day I found out, and she said she would be supportive of me no matter if I kept the baby or not. She said she won't raise the baby while I'm in college, however, that would be up to me. I don't blame her for this because she's constantly away for work and has to raise my younger siblings. I worked really hard to graduate top of my class and get into my dream school, so I don't want to mess it all up and flunk out because I'm raising a child. In addition, I have to live on campus and I don't want to go into labor in a dorm room and raise the child there for at least 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I told my boyfriend two days ago and explained to him that I planned on getting an abortion. He was completely against me and said I should keep the baby. I told him that if I did he would have to raise the child alone, and even then I would be hesitant as he is not very responsible. He said he expected me to raise the baby with him, and I said there was no way I was raising a child while going to college. He refused to listen to my points and eventually left.

&amp;#x200B;

I've ignored him since then and was still planning on getting an abortion. Now, I'm not so sure only because he wants me to keep it. I want nothing to do with the child. Should I keep the baby or not?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks everyone. My boyfriend has calmed down a lot, and I completely understand why he was worked up when I told him. While he still would rather me keep the child he's supporting my decision to get an abortion. I've got an appointment made and everything. While I'm sad that I had to make the choice for me it was the only one that made sense, and once again I appreciate everyone's advice."

So for context, about this happened around this time last year but he was dating the girl.  Sorry about the length.

This guy ( We'll call him J) is a mutual acquaintance that me (26f) and my husband (29M) and I have from work where we met. I went on a few dates with him back in the day but he was way too pushy and I was interested in my husband. Since then there have been a few weird moments over the years.

Once at a BBQ he grabbed my hand while we were talking and said something along the lines of ""oh OP I'm so sad we never got together, I'd be so good to you"". He was drunk and my husband probably would flipped so I let it slide. 

Well back to about a year ago I get a call from J (while my husband is at work, and he knew this) and he starts telling me about how his GF is pressuring him to get married, how he just doesn't want to be alone etc. I was trying to just be supportive but it starts taking a weird turn. He starts going off about how much better he would treat me than my husband and that I should leave hubby to be with him. Telling me he loves me and will take care of the child I have with hubby.

I'm completely flabbergasted because firstly, how can you love someone you barely know,  secondly why would he think I'd just drop my husband like a sack of potatoes.  I guess I was kinda in shock because I just tried to calmly tell him no but we could be friends (idk what I was thinking) and comforting him.

Welp, I told hubby and J denied it all, but hid with his tail between his legs. J is actually technically higher up than my hubby so I was worried when he confronted him.

Anyways I just saw on Facebook that these two are engaged, and I always felt icky not saying something to her, but I didn't want to hurt her. But seeing now that their engaged and he was doing this while they were together, I think she has a right to know, but at the same time she might already suspect something. I don't know how she can't as she worked with J and my hubby when everyone was talking about him trying to ""steal"" me.

Edit: spelling and grammar. 

INFO: J is technically higher up in the company than my husband, not by much but enough to worry about hubby being penalized because of my actions. They've also somehow managed to stay civil at work and almost seem to be getting along, so I'm debating maybe messaging her anonymously and giving her the information like it's a friend of mine, or someone from work who's telling her."

Now I can’t leave my house without breaking down. Hi. 

This happened about a week ago. I live in a small country town, the sort of place where everyone knows everyone. Whilst out shopping, a lady in the same isle as me started to have a heart attack and then seemed to go into cardiac arrest, she stopped breathing and went unconscious of the floor. 

I only recently did my first aid course about 2 weeks ago, i performed CPR to the best of my ability and told somebody else to call 000 (911 equivalent in Australia). At no stage did she regain consciousness or start breathing again and I have a horribly sick feeling that she didn’t make it. I’ve been trying to move past this and just reassure myself I did all that I could to save this lady.

The issue I’m having is that I’m having trouble leaving the house for anything at all, it makes me incredibly anxious and the thought of leaving the house makes me want to be sick. I can’t help but feel responsible for her likely passing away and it’s chewing me up inside. 

Thanks for reading. 

UPDATE: I just wanted to say thankyou to  everyone for all of your amazing advice and beautiful compliments, to have such amazing support from complete strangers has honestly helped a lot with this.

 I have taken everything everyone has said on board. I’ll be getting in touch with a therapist in the morning, as it does seem PTSD is a problem for me right now.

Is your favorite letter seven? ... and on and on, with probably around 25 questions like that until I try to change the subject.  I usually answer the questions with ""I don't know"".  I think he's partially trying to be funny, partially trying to avoid awkward silences, and partly unable to think of other things.  If I change it to a normal subject he'll participate for a minute and then go back to his questions.

We're both 36 y/o males.  He has some undiagnosed mental disorder, probably Schizoaffective Disorder (doctors have been trying to diagnose him our whole lives).  He's fairly smart -- he's completed college but hasn't been able to hold job for 10+ years.  He lives with his parents, has a car, is on disability, and they also seem to give him around a $50 allowance a week to spend on eating out and buying supplies for his hiking hobby.  He wants to hang out every single weekend.  

I hadn't been in contact with him until about 2 years ago, and he aggressively pursued a close friendship (I know for a fact he's not gay).  We would text several times a day until maybe 6 months ago when it just got too much.  He still texts the same amount but I don't reply to most of them.

I don't know how to deal with it anymore.  I want to be his friend and be there for him, but it's just starting to make me angry with how often he texts, how often he wants to hang out whenever I'm not working, and how I feel guilty when I don't answer his texts or make up excuses for not hanging out.  I try to ignore most of them now.  I once tried to give him the hint by not answering for an entire month one time, but his mother asked my mother if there's something he said to me that offended me.  When I finally texted him ""hey what's up man"" the constant texting immediately resumed.  He's suicidal and if he hasn't seen me in person for a couple weeks he'll hug me and tell me how much he missed me.  I know it wouldn't be my fault if he killed himself (everyone says it's on them not on you) but in reality everyone knows it'd be devastating and lead to a life of self-questioning, ""what if I was a better friend"".

I don't know what to say or do that could help make the constant stream of random clingy texts abate.  It feels as though it's either ghost him completely or live the rest of my life constantly making excuses of why I can't hang out with him every single weekend."

I have no idea where to start. I'm 22 years old and I live in a very rural area. Everyday I basically live the same day over and over. I am trapped in my home because I do not know how to drive. I am completely dependent on my parents, but I've expressed over and over again that I want to learn to drive but they refuse to teach me. My mom's excuse is that she taught my older sister and it's ""my dad's turn"". My dad says he is going to teach me, and it's been more than 4 years now. He always just says ""next week"", ""tomorrow"" etc. so I have basically just given up.

I'm 22 years old and I haven't had a friendship ever in my adulthood. Everyday I feel like I am missing out, which has bred depression that I have been battling for years. I also suspect to have other mental illnesses, but they are not diagnosed because I have no access to a mental health professional. My mother has diagnosed bipolar disorder, and she took medication for it. She said it made her hallucinate and that it's bad for you, so she has never allowed me to seek help. She said that therapy is just a joke, and medication just makes things worse. When I try to come to my parents for help they just dismiss me, and I don't know what to do. My transportation situation also makes me unable to find work.

For the past few months I've been feeling suicidal, and that's why I've finally decided to try to find some advice. I've tried to go to my family, but my mom told me not to tell anyone on her side of the family about anything. I feel very estranged from my dad's side, so there's no one I can go to on his side or anyone that I know closely. I have an older sister, but she has no contact with the family anymore. Once my mother taught her to drive she would disappear for days and weeks at a time, and eventually she moved out and she has little contact with us. (I don't blame her for this. My parents would pit me against her as a child. She also doesn't have the best relationship with our parents.) My grandmother wants a closer relationship with me, but she's in her 80s. I don't want to burden her with any of this, plus I overhear my father telling her negative things about me on the phone at times. It always feels like it's my parents word against mine when it comes to family.

If this information helps I do have an associates degree. I got it from a community college near my house and I finished up there in December of 2017, my father drove me back and forth to my classes. I wasn't able to make any friends at that time because I was really nervous to put myself out there. I kept my head down, went to school and came home when my dad picked me up. I had no way to transport myself to upkeep any friendships so I didn't pursue anyone.

I don't know why, but my dad has this weird control thing going on with me. He's told me before if I ever find a boyfriend he won't be able to help me with anything anymore because it would then be my boyfriend's job to deal with me. He also told me he doesn't want me to date.

My parents don't give me any guidance, I have no real life experiences, plus I'm dealing with untreated mental illness, so I'm 22 but mentally I feel like I'm 16 or something. It's hard for me to reason and come up with a solution, I just feel so stuck but I don't want to give up. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I feel panicked and just throwing everything out there, I've never tried to explain my situation before. Does anyone have any idea how I can get myself out of this? Any advice is appreciated.  


\*\*EDIT\*\*   


I'm getting a lot of responses so I can't reply to all of them, but I just want to say thank you so much. I've been dealing with all of this on my own for years, so having people listen to me and offer me some advice means more to me than you guys know. I'm very glad I posted because I have gotten some really good feedback and ideas that I wasn't able to think of myself.   


One thing that has stuck out to me is the advice on the military. I am going to do some research, but now it's definitely something I am interested in. I did have a kinda ehh plan about attending university in the fall, as I applied already and got accepted, but I'm not very sure about what I want to go into. The military just seems like a better option for me right now because I want to learn some independence, I want to be on my own and learn some structure.   


Thank you guys again, I haven't been able to see a way out of my situation in so long, but I'm feeling hopeful about things again, and I can't say I've felt this way in a long time.  "

I don't know how he died, only that it was sudden. I see his twin often, and now I know why he's been acting so different lately. I want to know what happened, I want to say something, but don't know what, or if I should. Any advice would be appreciated.


EDIT: Thanks for all the helpful perspectives. I feel much more clear-headed after a night's (fitful) rest, and I know I absolutely do not want to ask, just offer my condolences, and say how much I liked him (not crush-wise, just we used to socialize together and he was such a ray of pure sunshine), once I can express that while retaining my composure. 


I won't go digging for an explanation- even if I had one, I wouldn't be able to make his sudden and early passing make sense. His death was what it was, but who he was is so much more important to remember and think about. Thanks again everyone.


Original post follows:

I just found out today. I went to his family's business where he used to help out on holidays and I saw his obituary in a frame with a little plant underneath it at the cash. I can't describe the sad shock of it. It was like in a movie- the walls and floor falling away and the noise of the shop fading away to silence. I was overcome by the sadness of it, but also shocked. Still it explained perfectly the mood in the store now. It used to be so joyful in there. That was what it was like everywhere he went.


His family doesn't know me, but I know who they are because of his stories and things. 


I should also add that he was an unrequited love. I wasn't the right one for him, but he was my first big, head over heels crush and the first time I saw the possibility of something that was better than my playboy bachelor lifestyle. If I hadn't felt what I felt for him, I don't know if I would have recognized how rare and important that feeling was when I felt it a second time, for my (now) wife.


I guess all of this is just to say, he was huge influence in my life, bigger than I was in his. We fell out of touch- I backed off a bit because he found his partner (who was perfect for him!) I fell into a bad (abusive) relationship, then I got out and got sober and couldn't socialize around alcohol for a while. Then I got married and started a family... Life just kept happening.


We used to see eachother on Christmas Eve at his family's shop every year, though, and he'd give me such a great hug. Last year he wasn't there. Now I know why. I really thought we'd reconnect soon enough. I've been intentionally dropping by the store hoping to run into him. Now.... 


So. Should I ever ask what happened? Is there a way to express my condolences? I feel like I don't have a right. I just feel so badly for everyone who loved him. I don't want to hurt anyone, and if the information isn't out there, it must be private. I understand why I want an explanation, a reason, but that's not their problem, right?


If this is all over the place, it's because I only just found out today. Thanks for staying with it."

Just to start this out, I'm a 30yo woman. I've been employed consistently with only a few small gaps during college since I was 16, sometimes working two jobs at once. This doesn't come from a place of total naivete.

That said, The last 2.5 years I have been working a full time (40-50hrs per week), salaried, M-F, 730am-430pm job and I'm so depressed I don't know what to do.

Previous to this I always had one or two part time jobs and variable shifts and/or contract work. I never made enough money doing this stuff. I was always hustling and stressed, but I never felt as depressed as I do now.

Basically when I look at my life I don't recognize anything in it that I used to value. I don't have time to volunteer, work out, pursue my hobbies, spend as much time as I'd like with friends, or generally get out in the world. I just work, get home, put food in my face, put my house in order, try to relax for a little bit, go to bed, then do it again.

My commute is roughly an hour. If I arrive at work on time and leave promptly, that means I leave my house at 6:30 and return at 5:30. If I plan on getting 7-8 hours of sleep, I have to get ready for bed starting around 9:30. So four hours. Between catching up with my boyfriend, scraping together something for dinner (we don't order food or eat out much), doing chores, and other random crap, at most I get like an hour and a half to pursue leisure activities.

I have time on weekends but I am *so tired* by that point. I have much less stamina for weekend activities than I used to.

The **reality** of my life is that I don't go to bed on time and average 5-6 hours of sleep a night. I'm often late to work. I often stay late at work. I often have haircuts, therapy appointments, grocery shopping, plans with friends, and other things that cut further into the few hours every night after work and cause me to feel like I'm getting more and more behind.

I see people work 40+ hours and still do fun activities, volunteer, pursue personal projects, and even *raise children* for god's sake. I genuinely don't understand how this is physically possible.

Everyone else seems totally ok with this lifestyle. I try to confide in people about how miserable and empty I feel, and they just kind of go ""haha yeah that's life."" And then I feel like a complete piece of lazy shit for not being able to adapt to it.

For context, I have ADD and it may be making my time management more difficult than it should be. Also, my job is pretty crappy lately and is probably draining me mentally more than it should. However, it grants good vacation time (technically unlimited, in practice 3-4 weeks/year, which I *use*, dammit) and when I'm away I can like 98% check out and not think about it.

I'm looking for new work, but I'm afraid that it doesn't matter what kind of job I find, that I just can't hack it in the working world.

Can anyone give advice? Have you struggled with the same thing and got over it? How? Did finding a meaningful job help? Did improving your time management skills help? Am I just a lazy jerk who needs to suck it up?

&amp;#x200B;

**UPDATE**: Thank you all so much for the supportive comments, kind words, and great practical advice. I can't read it all or reply any more right now because I have to get back to work (lol) but I look forward to it later. A few things:

\-I'm seeing a therapist for about a month now and it's great and it's helping. I don't know about medication yet, but I'm feeling more open minded about the idea than I was before.

\-I'm going to start meal prepping. Everyone has mentioned it, and some IRL friends have as well. Rolling up my sleeves this weekend and breaking out the instant pot.

\-I'm looking for a new job and I'm going to prioritize a shorter commute. Though I like biking and busing, 2hrs/day is just too much of my life. I thought it was more normal but a lot of people seem to be saying it's a lot. I'm also going to seek a job that will feel more fulfilling. Frankly my current workplace is stressful and disorganized and I don't care about the field I'm in at all.

\-I've made a list of the things I want to incorporate back into my life that I used to enjoy, and I'm going to deliberately schedule some time at least once a week to pursue them.

It seems like so many people relate to what I described, so I hope everyone reading gets something useful out of the amazing comments here. &lt;3"

I mean the trip has been okay, but there's been so many points I've felt completely at a loss for what to do.

And it's making it hard to connect with people, because I'm already kind of burnt out, and I still haven't really gotten over the nerves.

Right now I'm in a pretty party oriented city, and I'm not really a big clubbing guy. But before this I was in a small surfer town, and that wasn't really my thing either.

I'm worried I'm just not going to be happy on this trip long term, and I don't really know what to do to change that.

I thought I would give a little update, I’m 18 and O’Neil was 10, he had been around for most of my life. He was diagnosed with kidney cancer Wednesday and was due to be put down Saturday. It was very fast. 

It was the hardest couple of days I have ever experienced. He wasn’t eating so we couldn’t give him anything and so he was getting weaker and weaker, by Saturday morning he could even get up. 

He was sad, I could see it in his eyes that he wasn’t himself but it’s heartbreaking not being able to do anything but stroke him. 

The drive to the vet was difficult because he was crying the whole time, the only time he stopped was when I spoke to him and told him everything was going to be okay. 

His whole family that loved him was there to comfort him  his last dying breaths. Sadness consumed my whole family when we were told he was gone but I felt both sadness and relief when I realised he wasn’t in pain anymore and was running around and chasing cats in doggy heaven. 

It’s hard, when I come home I expect to see both my dogs but only one greets me, I don’t think she knows yet. That’s going to be fun. 

I want to thank everyone who commented (apart from the person who called my dog an “it”) I really did try to listen to everyone’s comments.

Usually we hang out in public so it hasn't been an issue except for once in the past, but I'm hosting an event soon that she is invited to.

Last time she came to a party at my house, the couch where she sat was permanently damaged from her weight. I think she crushed the springs or something because it never ""bounced back"".

I have a VERY nice dining room set. It's a family heirloom, and I don't think the chairs could support her weight. I don't want to risk trying it. I have another sturdier chair that I value much less that would work for her, but how do I broach asking her to not sit in my good chairs without hurting her feelings?

So I moved from North America to Europe in 2014 for university. I have dual citizenship, so I don't pay tuition here. I also had met a guy online (WOW, hehe), so I decided to move.

The last year of my bachelor, I was pretty depressed. My relationship had failed, I didn't have any friends, I still couldn't get permenant residency in this country, etc. So I decided to chew on the idea of moving home. 

Then I ended up being accepted to a masters degree, got permenant residency, and a new boyfriend. Also made some friends, and started doing more activities. Turned out I really love it here.

The thing is, whenever I talk to my mum about stuff, she'll always sneak it into the convo about me moving back. I bought a new board game a while ago, her first response was ""how will you pack that?"". Then yesterday she said she missed me and wished I could come for dinner. I said I missed her too. Then she said it'll be great when I can come for dinner whenever I want. I've told her I have no intention of moving back to North America.  I miss them, but I don't like it. I don't want to live there. She just doesn't listen to me.

I'm in my final year of masters now, and my family has never once visited me, so I invited them for Christmas. Mum just said ""you're moving home in June, we'll see you then"".

We saved up and bought my dad a digital camera for his 70th birthday/retirement two years ago, and he has been having a lot of fun getting back into the artistic side of himself. He spends most weekends at the Oregon Coast, and has found a niche of photography that he enjoys and that has actually gotten his work into a couple galleries down there. The problem that he is running into now though is that these places label each piece with the medium used (eg. acrylic, ceramic, photography) and he is unsure of how to accurately categorize his art, or explain it to people easily without giving away all the ""mystique"" of how the effect is accomplished. 

His process is basically this as far as I understand it: He finds a piece of driftwood (or kelp, or some rocks in the surf) that he finds interesting. He takes a photo of a small part of it, an inch to 6-inch or so square usually. He may see a cool shape or a face in the wood, or just likes how the light is playing off it, or what have you. He will then take that photo and alter the image with editing software to change the lighting, color saturation, hue, etc. (he is not super technologically savvy, but he can crop and change the hues and I guess that's all he wants/needs). The end result is typically pretty unrecognizable from the gray driftwood that it started out.

[Here are a couple of his pieces](https://imgur.com/a/iQZhQ5V).

People often look at his work and think they are just abstract art, and then are taken aback and confused when a piece is labeled as photography; some have even said they thought it was a mistake in labeling. At the same time, he feels like like once he explains his process people view his work as lesser than some of the other forms of art in the gallery and don't appreciate the pieces the same way they did when they first looked and thought it was an abstract painting. He has been so excited about his new hobby and community at the coast, but it gets him down that he feels like he is not respected as an artist because of his medium.

Basically it seems like he's looking for a way to label his art that is more specific than just ""photography"" so that the label can stand on its own and have people understand it better without the explanation. 

I want to help him, but not being in the art community myself or really familiar with digital media I've come up pretty much empty so far. I have pitched ""Abstract Driftwood Macro-Photography"", but he's not quite sold on that.

What do you folks think?

Edit: Wow, I didn’t expect this to get so much attention, thank you all so much! I’ll pass along your praise and ideas to my dad. ☺️

For those asking about purchasing, my uncle is helping him set up a website to start selling but it’s not ready yet (and don’t even get me started about an Instagram, it’s an ongoing battle and I’m a lil salty about it, lol). 

He has given me permission to share his FB page here so people can see more of his work and message him with inquiries.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, we have been together 17 years. Up until some point in 2017 she was caring, responsible, and hard working.

She started a new job and was doing well. She then met a guy she worked with and began lying/hiding conversations and claim she was working late, when actually they were hanging out in the work parking lot.

Around this time she went manic and spent the next year being hateful and narcissistic. it was also around this time that I found out she had been an alcoholic for a long time, but was able to hide it due to my work hours.

After a year of abuse and lies, she quit drinking and got meds for her bi-polar disorder. Instead of working on herself and trying to make up for her wrongs. She has spent the last year and a half continuing to lie about everything. Even when caught, she would double down on the lie.

She spent 6 months jobless. I had to sell off a car i bought brand new (only one payment left) to catch up on bills, I also had to take a second job to make ends meet. All while she slept up to 20 hours a day. Since then i have spent all of my energy outside  on trying to get her to figure out what was wrong and to fix it.

After another year of her doing the bare minimum to just make it through the day, still lying about pretty much everything. My oldest kid (13) brought up Saturday night that ""mom made me not like you for a long time. Mom lied and said you were controlling, manipulative, and abusive. and that she (daughter) was sorry for believing her mom because it was all obviously a lie."" I of course assured her that it wasn't her fault, its her job to believe her mom. I also told her to not be mad at her mom because she was having mental health issues back when she was saying these things.

I let my wife know about this conversation and that she needed to apologize to our daughter. Wife claims to have no memory of this saying these things, but agrees that she will make it right with the kid. I know she did say this stuff because of things she would say when manic and trying to upset me during disagreements. the thing is, she never even thought to apologize to me about saying this stuff. It was at this point I realized she still does not feel any guilt or remorse for what she does, and would not change.

I left Sunday afternoon after this conversation, and came back Monday. She had to beg her mom to stay there for two days, and left Monday afternoon. She texted me multiple times telling me how she wanted to come back and that she misses me. I replied with saying ""I miss the old you, but she's been gone for three years now.""

She came back to our house today since her mom kicked her out. After so long of begging her to figure out why she changed so badly and did everything I could to get her to put effort into getting better, she only now claims to have figured out what has caused her to be so lazy, selfish, and hurtful.

I am bitter, confused, and have no energy left to put into this relationship, and have told her as much. She still wants to try and fix 'us."" I told her there hasn't been an ""us"" for three years, its just been me and its just yet another selfish act on her part to try and fix things now that I am done and burnt out.

I let her know that she needs to get right for herself and our kids, and that i am not promising to be around even if she gets herself figured out. Even if she goes back to being her old self, I fear I have been through too much to ever forgive and trust her again.

I love her dearly, but to quote someone from here ""I will not keep lighting myself on fire to keep her warm.""

**Question: is it fair to her for me to let her drag this out any more? I am extremely bitter and have been shown for three years that her words cannot be trusted. I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive her and trust again.**

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: thank you all for the responses and time. I will be responding to everyone as quick as I can. I am taking my time though, because I am trying to process it all as I move response to response.

Edit2: The response to this was overwhelming. I didn't think it would receive many responses because my writing style is hard to read and isn't as polished as it should be (I'm a chef, not a writer lol). **I think the best option is a trial separation while we both seek help individually, and as a couple.**

Edit3: I am stepping away for a bit (mostly to go buy the recommended books). I will jump back on this afternoon."

It's just casual talk so he asks me about my granduncle.
He said that they were really bonded in the good ol' days and that they were basically like brothers.

My grandma used to have a lot of siblings so that particular branch of my family is a bit obscure for me, adding the fact that we don't get to see each other very often and that I have very poor memory for names and alike, I flinched a bit but, after having explained that I didn't hear from them for a while, I said that I guessed he was alright.

He nodded, saying that he had to pay him a visit sometime.

When I returned home I suddenly realized…

My granduncle is dead and I didn't even have mentioned it. How can I say it now? I'm so sorry...

Update: I gathered up all my strength to be as direct as possible today, it went exceptionally better than I was expecting, we talked as usual and I brought up my granduncle's death to which I saw his lips tightening, maybe he was holding in some tears but after a moment of embarrassment we just simply talked about how great of a human being my granduncle had been to his family and I think I got home with a better lesson than mathematics: today we are alive, tomorrow we don't know, now it's the right time to let those you love know that they're been special for you, if you wait too much you could possibly never get another chance"

I'm 6 months from graduation but her abuse of power is starting to make me more depressed every day that I don't quit. What can I do? I attend a college in Ohio. I take night classes 4hrs/ 4 days a week for a Medical Assisting career. I only have two teachers. Of those two, one blantlently refuses to teach us our material &amp; is abusing her power by constantly attacking our grades within her classes when we complain about her. She is in charge of 3/4 classes that are required. 

From the very beginning of our school year she has done nothing to teach us. At first my class thought maybe she was getting things together since of course it was a new school year. But after 3 weeks of us literally sitting in class while she sat at her desk on her phone, computer, or just openly using our class time to talk about her personal life it became obvious we werent going to be learning anything from her. Instead of lecturing our class about the medical field, demonstrating, or simply talking about what it's like working in the medical field. Her way of ""teaching"" was to assign a chapter and have us highlight what we needed to know from our book in order to fill out study guides. A problem with this was that the highlights didnt even pertain to what our study guides were asking, sometimes not even in the chapter or highlights we were told to use by her. And with us not even knowing what the hell we were looking at it was unbearable. But that's how we learn. From our book, Google, or amongst each other while she does whatever she wants with her time. 

It got to the point where our director subbed for her and noticed absolutely our class lack of knowledge. She was reviewing a topic we had been on for weeks and not a single one of us could answer her questions. It turned out there was a bunch of stuff on the topic our teacher obviously didnt teach us, and what my class read from the book was nothing compared to what we needed to know. It was so upsetting. We tested on the subject that night ahead of schedule simply because our director knew we all would've failed had she not took our entire class time to go over and teach the subject to us. We all thought she would've done something to make change after witnessing that but nothing was done. 

Theres an honor system to follow. Multiple people in my class including me have made complaints to our teacher. She tells us we're pouting or tells us theres nothing for her to teach and that blows my mind. Multiple people including me have made our complaints clear with the director with nothing done. There's a conflict of interest with the two because they're friends. Everytime someone complains to our director, our teacher confronts our entire class with such aggressiveness, its hostile. Three times this has happened ""what's the problem!?"" ""I will not stand for complaints being made about me!"" Is always what she says. 

In the beginning of our 2nd qt her classes became longer, 2 hrs. For the first 3 months she assigned 2 sole assignments that she completely abandoned. We had no idea what was going on. For 3 months we came into class and sat on our phones while she did the same, or used class for an entire 2 hrs to talk about herself. It was a total 2 hr study hall... in college. For 4 hrs that we are required to be there 2.5 (30 min lunch) were being dedicated to NOTHINGNESS. She was in the middle of moving and I know it attributed to our lack of assignments and their abandonments. 

At this point students really became fed up. One its obvious our classtime is being utilized in an unprofessional manner. Two our complaints werent being taken seriously. And three we were showing up to college for a study hall, with zero learning going on. At times me and other students would just return to our previous teachers class in order to get some type of education in for the last two hours of school, which wasnt fair for her because she has another class to teach after us but she understood and allowed it only once.

A morning student had switched over to our nights and within a week complained. Morning classes get alot more attention and education. Since we are nights we only require 4 hrs instead of 8, and at night theres no other classes around. When this student complained to the director, that same night we walked into class with our teacher noticeably pissed off. We all sat down as she again confronted us. The student went head to head with our teacher letting her know the program is coming off as a scam, our teacher sits on her ass while we sit there miserably for 2 hrs. I couldn't agree more. Instead of acknowledging the complaints she began attacking the student to which I intervened to let her know she as a teacher should not be attacking a student for being honest. With us telling her yet again ""you dont teach us anything""

After this our teacher retaliated by assigning 2,304 question exam for us to take in 4 weeks before the end of the quarter. On this exam was material we've never even heard of. Then she assigns a medical terminology paper, which was another subject abandoned and not taught by her. When students asked how to find the answers she responded ""look it up"". People stopped showing up to her class after that. People literally gave up. 

We dont get any breaks at my school like other colleges besides the weekend. It was pointless for people to show up to class for nothing, and especially with this kind of attitude being thrown at us. Once this happen our teacher retaliated even more by randomly assigning 200-500 pt assignments on days people didnt show and said for those that didnt show were getting a 0 and werent going to be able to make them up. Which wasnt the policy, we had always been able to make up our work for half points the next day, anything after that was a 0. Again, for an entire 2-3 months she hadn't assigned us anything. She was obviously retaliating and using her power as a teacher to attack our grades.

This week was the end of our 2nd qt and time to take our finals. If we didnt pass we couldn't move on. For weeks our class asked our teacher what our finals were on, the entire qt we pretty much learned nothing and had done nothing. Her response was ""it's a surprise I like keeping you guys on your toes, on the edge"" and laughing about it. It wasnt funny to anyone. It's our right as students to know what the hell we are being tested on in order to study especially when it determines our future at the school. 

Turned out our final was on the two chapters she had abandoned in the beginning of the qt. Because of the fact that she abandoned it and we were in turn taking a final on it she let us take it in partners with open book. She told us ""she was being nice"" but no in reality she would've been in a bunch of shit had we all failed because she refused to tell us what was on the final, being material she didnt teach us. It took our class over 2 hrs. Some students stayed after class hours to finish or had to leave blanks because they couldn't find the answers. All with open book and partners. It took our class 30 minutes max without studying to take our other teachers final because she actually teaches us. We discussed with our other teacher how she kept refusing to give us any information on the final and she said herself it makes no sense and as a teacher shes setting us up to fail. 

I've now contacted the head of education who now also seems to take these concerns lightly. I set up a meeting with her, she asked what day and time would work I told her 5pm, I live an hour away, and my boyfriend doesnt get off until 4pm, with rush hour its impossible for me to make it any earlier. Shes only there one day a week and told me she leaves at 4:30. She wouldn't wait 30 minutes for me to get there in order to discuss what's been going on. 

All of this is seemingly like a scam. I've managed to keep my grades as As and Bs but when I enrolled the only reason I signed for this specific school was because I was told they have smaller classes, the teachers were hands on, and they offered tutoring. They've denied us tutoring since the beginning of the school year, and obviously I have only one teacher that has been hands on in teaching us. Had it not been for her I would be 6 months to graduation with 0 knowledge of the Medical Asssisting career. 

It's the start of the 3rd qt and my teacher has now made up a new policy that she wont accept any late work, so if we dont show up one day we cant make up any work for her. This is a horrible feeling. They already have a policy if you miss a day you lose 25pts for the day and now I have to worry even more. I used to love coming to school and now I hate it. I feel like I'm being punished constantly rather than getting an education. 

What else can I do? I dont want to give up but this school is starting to affect my life so negatively."

**UPDATED POSTS** I made one on r/letsnotmeet but it got deleted :/ I know everyone is keen on hearing the update so I have pasted it into the comments below as a direct copy, I'm too tired at this point to edit it down, sorry :( 

There are also further updates at the end of this post including what happened today (17/6) while the original event was now yesterday (16/6).

**What happened**

Urgh, OK. So this happened less than two hours ago and I'm still reeling from the entire experience so please bear with me as I'm getting this out.

I live about a mile from the nearest convenience store, which I walk to a couple of times a week. Today I was on my way back and it was just gone midday when this happened. My journey back involves going through a train station. It is pretty small, only one platform and I'm walking towards it as a train pulls in and one person gets off.

I see the person walking towards me, then it starts raining. I should point out, I listen to music when I walk but I'm always aware of my surroundings, being a 5'4"" female, it seems necessary to do so. He reaches me and says something which I can't hear because of the music. I take out one headphone taking a mental note of this person and my surroundings at this point because I'm socially awkward at the best of times, so my brain goes into hyper awareness mode.

This person greets me as if he knows me, talking about the weather and how he's going to see his kids (as it's father's day and all) and blah blah blah. All the time he's getting closer and closer to me and I'm starting to panic. Glancing around to see if there are people nearby (we're next to some houses and a busy road but there's no one around because of the rain).

I'm struggling to remember this person. I'm still 99.9% convinced I don't know him. But he's still acting as if he knows me, when I asked politely how he knew me he simply glossed over the question. He keeps getting closer and I'm running out of space to move backwards at this point. My brain is screaming at me to get away but I'm trying not to do anything that might antagonise this person. 

I make a move towards the station and he says he'll walk back with me, but now he's started to compliment me. ""Oh you always did have such beautiful eyes"" and ""it's so nice to see you again"", ""it's a shame you have to walk back in this weather"" he tells me trying to put his arm around me. I step out of the way just before he does.

We reach the station and he's still talking, and still he's trying to get too close. At several points he's got within centimeters of my face as if he wants to kiss me, and then when I look down or away he backs off slightly. I also want to point out that this person was dressed smartly, not in a suit or anything, but he looked perfectly normal. He didn't smell of alcohol and he didn't seem to be on drugs or anything. Plus it was the middle of the day. 

He kept touching me, nothing too awful, hand on the shoulder, or the back, once to my face. Urgh, I still feel so utterly creeped out thinking about this. But I just know if I didn't look down or away every time he tried to kiss me, he would have done so and that's when I'd have truly freaked out. It makes me shudder to think exactly what was going through his mind. What totally weirded me out though was that he told me that he'd be back there later on today and that we should hang out and stuff. He even told me what time he's going to be there. He seemed excited by the idea that I might go back (obviously this is the last thing in the world I would do, I never want to see him again). 

If I know this person, I don't recognise him, and even if I did know him I would never have let him act like that around me as I mentioned, I'm socially awkward and have issues with physical contact. Only my partner gets that close to me and doesn't make me feel uncomfortable.

So thankfully he finally took the hint when I said I had to go, though he seemed really put out, to the point where he hugged me, again, for what seemed like forever until I physically detached myself from him said bye and basically speed-walked away. As soon as I was out of his eye and ear shot I was on the phone to my partner and he talked to me the whole way back while he walked in my direction. I was constantly looking behind me to make sure I wasn't being followed.

This person didn't actually hurt me, but I don't think his intentions were exactly pure and I believe I dodged a bullet. I feel extremely creeped out that this could happen in broad daylight to anyone. I think ultimately I'm incredibly lucky that it didn't go anywhere near as bad as it could have done. My partner is keen to go back this evening and talk to the guy, and he really means to only talk to him, he isn't violent by any stretch but he could easily floor this guy if it came to that.

So, reddit. What should I do about this creepy encounter? I've ruled out calling the police as he didn't actually hurt me, and I am definitely not going back there alone later. I would just like an answer as to his behaviour and my partner thinks having words with him might put him off ever treating anyone like that again. I'm left feeling totally weirded out, like I want to scrub myself with bleach to get rid of the feeling. This isn't the first time something bizarre like this has happened to me, but it hasn't in a very long time so it has totally thrown me. Any (useful) advice would be much appreciated. 

If you read this far, you deserve a **BOX** of cookies!

Edit 1: RIP my inbox lol. But in all seriousness, I would like to thank each and every one of you who took the time to comment. I have read each and every one of them, and I am honestly blown away! Your support has enabled me to begin to process what has happened today. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I'm sorry if it's taking me ages to respond, but I'm kinda drowning in virtual support heh. There are lots of things that I'm going to take away from this experience, but the main thing is my restoration in humanity. I went from experiencing one of the worst examples of humanity to so many of the amazing examples to ever exist and for that I am extremely grateful &lt;3

**Edit 2**

**NO ONE IS READY FOR EDIT 2**

NOW I'M READY TO CALL THE ACTUAL POLICE. But I think the after-aftermath requires its own, new post. Will link back here when it's done. &lt; Tried to do this, it got deleted but, again, the I C&amp;Pd as its own comment because it was well gone 1am before I finally slept last night, and after taking the time to make the post, I couldn't have edited it down if my life depended on it. Some have said I should have put it here, but I already feel like this post is a BEHEMOTH and it doesn't need to be any longer. 

**Edit 3. Nothing new to report but...**

It is approaching bed time for me, but I'll be honest. Today has been *hard* and I don't know if I will get much sleep. Trying hard to not to dwell on what might have been but be grateful that I managed to escape unscathed. Having said that, I'm left feeling anxious and afraid. 

I've said it before, but it bears repeating. **Thank you so much** to everyone who took the time to reply, I've long since lost control over keeping up with the comments but I will keep trying for as long as I can tonight and pick it up again tomorrow. Thank you, kind Internet strangers for all your comments I have taken a lot away from today but primarily that for every one awful person there are literally hundreds of amazing people and that restores my faith in people so much :).

**Edit 4. The day after the event.**

So, the initiated at this point have probably seen it, but in case you don't want to have to read yet MORE WORDS, I found out my creepy encounter was with a registered sex offended that is known to the police. My partner and I went out together, making sure to walk the same route as I feel the sooner I get up on the horse (so to speak) the better. I refuse to let what happened to me further compound my already fragile mental health. I wasn't looking forward to approaching the police but it went so much better than I expected.

At first it was obvious the officer wasn't much interested, but as soon as I told him this person physically touched me I was invited into an interview room to give a statement. He asked me lots of questions, and since half of the encounter happened on a public road, and the other on a train platform, this person could be prosecuted by both the police and the transport police (I had no idea that's how they operated either!). It could also mean he's banned from this station, meaning he'd have to find another way to travel here. This is good for several reasons.

I have been given a crime number, and a really handy little booklet detailing what will happen next and where I can go to for support etc. The officer told me someone would be in touch, and I was happy to leave it there. Right before we left we told the officer we had a picture and a video of this person and he asked to see it. When we showed him the photo, an instant look of recognition crossed the officer's face. He isn't allowed to give out information, obviously, but it was clear from his reaction that this person isn't a stranger to the police. We talked a little further with our neighbours and we now have his full, real name. We're not going to go vigilante with this situation, obviously but I will continue to warn anyone I can, including our landlord who will ensure this person isn't allowed on the site where I live. I never thought I'd say it but I'm glad where we live is highly populated and he wouldn't get far if everyone knew who to look out for.

Anyway. I swear to the internet gods, aside from replying to comments, there won't be another word here after this one."

So about a week ago, my wife decided to try and do her own nails at home while I was working. This effectively turned our small apartment into a noxious, heinous-smelling nail salon. Upon my return from work I entered through the door and immediately proceeded to have to leave because the smell (similar to paint-thinner) was simply overwhelming... Gave me a massive headache. My wife (cutely) said ""Oh I'm used to this, I've always gone to nail salons growing up.""   


So, I demanded that we open all the windows and doors to air the place out and did so for a few hours. In addition we burned some candles after I suspected most of the (possibly flammable or reactive) fumes had left the place.   


Problem is, it's almost a week later and while the smell is \*pretty much\* gone, every time I enter the apartment there is still a slightly nauseating/irritating smell of toxic and bitter smell from her failed nail experiment.   


Any suggestions? Asking for my health and sanity :)


*Update* for those who misunderstood or I failed to clarify: My wife was in fact using acrylic monomer. NOT just painting her nails with an acetone-based paint. 

A couple things: 
- THANK YOU to those who gave advice, instead of calling my wife a “ho” or calling me dramatic. 

- Some people could really use a chill pill before getting on reddit and accusing me of being mean to my wife (she liked this post btw) or saying it’s all in my head lmao.

- *The title is also to grab your attention. Again, people need to chill*"

I am a teenager and I've been raped a year and a half ago, and I'm still fucked up because of it. I'm just going to say this post will be confusing because this is like the 5th time I'm rewriting it.

I think I'm going to have sex with my bf pretty soon. I'm not scared of the thought but every time we get close to doing it I start having flashbacks and shaking and I always have to take a few minutes to calm myself down because I can't even talk. I want to have my first time with him but I know that I'm still going to shake and I'll need so, so much support and him just calming me down when I start getting scared. I'm afraid to asking him that support. I know it's a lot to ask on its own, but everything makes it impossible.
I'm scared that I would ruin it for the both of us.

He's always had a different way of seeing these things because all the girlfriends he's had in the past ended up cheating on him. I'm assuring him I would never cheat on him this but then this happened. I don't think it counts as cheating but I know that in his head he's panicking. As soon as I even mention what happened (which I don't do often) the conversation gets..awkward. I can tell he doesn't want to talk about it and neither do I, but sometimes it's necessary.

I don't want to break up with him at all because he really is the best guy ever and I love him, so I'm asking for advice here. Thanks in advance for any replies.


Edit: Man this has gotten way more attention than I expected. I'm kind of sad that this is just a throaway account because I'll end up not being able to see all these nice words anymore along with that sweet, sweet karma haha."

He's a full grown man in his 40s. He was bringing these really young girls around who I assumed were friends with his kids. Or they were in college and he met them through this mental health program. Nope. Definitely underage.

My take is that he's so used to a therapeutic setting where you're told everything is okay that he can't see that this thing isn't okay. He talks about the parents as if they're psychopaths for not wanting their girls to go to a grown man's apartment.

I mentioned that it's dangerous for a full grown man to be alone with a female minor but he didn't take it seriously. He even asked if we could take this girl _camping_ after I spoke to him about it. Right, because I've always wanted my license plate to be the subject of an Amber alert.

I don't think there's anything sexual but the whole thing is so inappropriate. I've been trying to distance myself from him but I'm concerned he may hurt himself. At the same time, the shit needs to stop. Simply stepping away feels like a copout.

EDIT: For everyone advising to call the police, I looked into it a bit and it appears that in my state the one girl I know anything about is the legal age of consent. I'm also concerned that it would cause him to hurt himself so it would only be if I suspected there was a sexual relationship with someone that wasn't the age of consent. I don't want to cause him harm for no reason.

EDIT: The winning response here seems to be to contact his therapist or the hospital where we met. They're mandatory reporters but will also know the best way to go about it. They'll also know whether it's something that should be reported. I'll be doing that shortly. If I hear anything back I'll update. I'd imagine it's the last I'll be hearing of it since I'm not trying to spend any more time around this person. Thank you everyone for the advice. It's really given me more perspective.

UPDATE: A mental health professional has been notified."

Backstory: I'm 16 years old and I'm female, and I go to a school that allows us to finish high school classes by our junior year and begin earning college credits as early as our sophomore year; which in turn gives us an almost guaranteed scholarship (full ride) to the university which houses our high school program. A lot of info but it's important.

I began talking with this girl who I'll call Z about four months back. We'd gone to school together since our freshmen year but, it was't until second semester of our sophomore year that we actually got to know each other. She came out and told me that she was questioning her sexuality but, she had a crush on me. And one thing leads to another, and we've been talking for a while now. This all began last week when she'd chose to confide in me about ""something important"" and that night, she called me and confessed that she had been raped four times. She didn't want to go into detail but after me pressing for a bit more information, she confessed that as a child she'd been raped twice by an uncle, once by a cousin and again by her father.

She and her siblings were sent to live with their dad when they were much younger. She had two older sisters and younger brother (her oldest sister passed last year from cancer). If her dad hadn't chosen to take them in, they would've been put into foster care by their mother -- this makes her feel like she owes him. Z told me all of this on a Saturday night and by Monday morning, she told me that she hadn't told the entire truth. But that her dad still molests her.

She is unfortunately, very sick and often times has to go to the hospital for treatments but, the argument between us stemmed because she wasn't taking her medicine. Z told me the reason why was because she had to run out the house before her dad tried to take her to the hospital which, obviously, alarmed me. This is when she confessed that she was scared to ride alone in the car with him. It's been a week and a half since she told me and things have become much more alarming since then.

Z has three other siblings living in the house but, has never told them about the abuse. She says that he only rapes her because he ""doesn't like her"" and leaves the others alone. He catches her before she leaves for the bus because her siblings have already left the house before her and shes often come to school with her legs aching and bruises on her wrists and neck. The reason why I've decided to post this is because I'm terrified for her; her dad is forcing her to stay home from school tomorrow but hasn't told her why although she already knows why. I don't know what I can do because along with being a rapist, hes insanely homophobic (We've gotten by as pretending to be 'best friends').

She has no other family in the state, so if she were to get police involved, shed be taken from the home and removed from her siblings. If she's sent to live with a relative, she'll be forced to give up her scholarship at our school and lose everything she'd been working towards for the past two years as well as the friends shes made and me.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: So there's a bit I forgot to mention in my original post. 

Firstly, Z did end up sneaking out of the house early Tuesday morning so she was able to go to school. She stayed home today to get her sister to braid her hair and has been texting me throughout the day (nothing about the abuse has come up so I think she was safe) as her dad was in class all day.

1. We live in the USA 
2. As insane as it sounds, I genuinely can't rely on guidance counselors from my school. Along with this, I'm often going in to talk about students who I know have a rough time (I've had to go three times in the past month because a friend of mine told me he was seriously considering suicide and it took that many times before they intervened) 
3. I don't want to go to the police because the only people she's ever told this to are myself and another boy whose is her best friend; she'd know it was me. I won't jeopardize the things shes worked for, unless she gives me the okay. 
4. Our school is housed in a small building on the campus of a large university. If you move, get expelled, or otherwise removed from the school; your scholarship opportunity is revoked. 
5.  I cannot confide in my parents. My mom reacts irrationally and is very hard to talk to about normal things; let alone something of this importance. She'd likely over-react and do something irrational that could possibly jeopardize Z's life even more. 
6. I don't try to pressure Z into things so, she usually tells me more about the abuse in little bits over the course of days. As I learn more, I will try to update this post as well. 

I really appreciate all of the replies and support. I was lost without a clue of what to do. It took me two days to reply to all these messages because I was so anxious about what people would say or if they'd said anything at all. Thank you all so much!"

He was in an accident not too long ago and was in hospital for 3 weeks, I knew where he was.. but I never went to see him. He died 4 days ago !! His family then got in touch with me and told me funeral arrangements and asked me if I was going to attend... I told them no, I would not be there. And of course... I am being bombarded with horrible messages from them and being told how much of a disrespectful person I am. 

My thoughts are... the man didn’t bother with me for 20 years of my life.. none of that family bothered with me, even though they knew how to reach me and contact me, why should I go to a mans funeral that I didn’t even know... a stranger?? Just because he has the title of being my “dad”? 

I have been feeling really low about it all recently and would just like some feedback, losing my mind on wether or not I’m being a terrible person, it’s putting my judgment off balance !!!"

I am now with him, and feel no interest being with girls, or anyone else, besides him. He keeps mentioning that he would be okay with me kissing girls, and potentially having sex with them, because he wants me to “have fun and experiment”. This honestly makes me a bit sick, cause when I asked “What if it was a guy?” He freaks out and says “No that is cheating!”. I feel as if the “have fun and experiment” isn’t for me, but for him, for his fetish....

We had this issue a few years back, when he kept trying to convince me to have a threesome with a girl. I kept saying no, cause it made me really uncomfortable. To make him understand how I felt, I said; “What if we had a threesome, and I invited a man?” And he told me to never do that and that he thought it was gross.

He keeps asking me what I think of girls, if I would “do them” or if I would be interested in having a threesome with them.

I am kind over this, because I feel like he sees my sexuality as an opportunity to pleasure himself or live his own sexual fantasies and it is so fucking weird to me. 
I don’t want to have sex with anyone else, I don’t want to be in a relationship with anyone else, I want to be with him and not involve anyone in our sex life. How do I REALLY make this clear to him? Cause the “No, this makes me uncomfortable” doesn’t seem to be working.

I've had a friend for a year--he's 21 soon to be 22--and he has something called a ""Tulpa."" It's basically a very real (to him), very complex, imaginary friend. He has struggled with depression, hopelessness, and lack of friends, so he created his imaginary friend to, well, have more friends. This imaginary friend somewhat serves as his voice of reason, his ""what he should do."" He tells me it try to keep him positive, it tries to comfort him, it tries to motivate him to be productive, basically a lot of positive things in his life. I get it, it's weird to have an imaginary friend at the age of 22, but it benefits him and keeps him from being as depressive as he apparently used to be when he was younger, and it prevents him from trying to commit suicide like he did when he was both 17 and 19. So, albeit weird, this thing is kind of positive, I'd guess. No harm, right?

So this Tulpa is allegedly a female friend, and he told me today that he's been having sex with it, and my immediate reaction is what the hell, this guy is off the deep end a bit. And then he had no idea why I thought that was concerning considering he's never had a girlfriend, nor very many friends. I'm not sure which was more shocking, the fact he thought having sex with an imaginary friend (don't even ask me how, not a clue) was okay, or the fact he had no idea why I was concerned/worried/upset upon hearing that? He's a very troubled and emotional person, I've tried to help him, and he'll be going to Therapy in a couple months once his insurance kicks in, but right now I'm just floored. I'm stunned. And he tells me his imaginary friend encourages him to have sex with him, which just makes me think he's succumbed to the delusions in his own head. Really it's just... all so shocking and terrible, and maybe I'm overreacting or under-reacting, but I just don't know how a normal person reacts to his.

Like. obviously that's not right? He needs help, right? How far gone is he? He holds down a job and has a few friends, but is anti-social and doesn't go out and stays inside a lot. I don't expect some super medical, psychological response (though one would be appreciated), but I'd like some sort of response or answer so I know how to approach it, or if I should let sleeping dogs lie. He's a little socially awkward, misses social cues, but he's fairly... functional, I guess? He was mostly sane I thought, just severe depression and the imaginary friend quirk I tried to justify all of it, but now I don't know what to think. Any advice on how I should help him, approach him, or anything really?"

**Post starts here**

A good friend of mine has had a rough year.  

She's one of the most beautiful souls I know, inside and out.  

Amongst several over things, an unexpected and sad thing that happened earlier in the year, she had to go into hospital to see a specialist in September. There she found out she would need to have surgery.

Her boyfriend met her after to take her home - and broke up with her. 

In mid Dec she had an operation - it was supposed to be a fairly simple surgery for 2 hrs,  but ended up being a 6hr major surgery. She was in hospital for several days before being discharged.   

A family member was supposed to be staying to help her while she recovered.  However just after she got home, they said ""you're fine, you don't need me here."" and left. 

Since then my friend has mostly been by herself. I've messaged her a bit and chatted to her on the phone a couple of times.  Her family member hasn't replied to any of her messages or calls since they left.  We invited her around for a very low key Christmas lunch. On Christmas Eve I messaged her again and said we'd love to see her and that it would be very relaxed low key.  Again on Christmas day, i sent her a text wishing her a merry Christmas and saying we missed seeing her but hope she had a good day and saying the invite was still open and we could pick her up if she needed.  I know mutual friend did the same as well, but got no reply and thought he was harassing her after a while, so left it. 

I spoke to her before new years and she said she was feeling a bit cooped up and would like to do something. We were planning on doing something right around the corner from her and invited her to come with us and she said she wanted to come for a little bit.  Touched base with her on NYE about where to meet, what to wear etc right up until about 9.30pm, then she stopped replying.  

Messaged her again a few days after new years and got no reply.  

Then last night a get a message from her saying she thinks her health is going backwards, she's not ok, she's crying right now.  She feels alone, like she's been isolated for weeks and hasn't seen any people, that everyone she loves has abandoned her.  

I know that all of her family (other than the one)  are over seas/ interstate, and that family member who did leave hasn't even tried to see how she is. But I know that I and another mutual friend have been trying to keep in touch with her, invited her out, offered to go to her etc, and whenever we do, she'll normally stop replying, so there are at least two people keeping in touch. (Although I know that's not very many).

I'm no stranger to MH issues, and I know that things can get wrapped and twisted around on your head.

I'm just not really sure what to do to try and support her.  

When people do reach out to her, for whatever reason she doesn't want to do xyz so often won't reply or will decline, but she's also getting increasingly depressed/anxious, feeling isolated and abandoned, which is a vicious cycle. 

I have a couple of times thought of sending her something, I know where she lives, but don't know her specific apartment number, so can't drop anything off, or even send her a card or flowers.

Should I contract some other mutual friends and suggest they send her a quick hello?  I don't want to tell people that she not ok if she doesn't want them to  know and betray her trust, but I think having a few friends reach out could be good?  (Or could be overwhelming?). She can be quite private person, but I know these people would be concerned and try to support her if they could. 

Any advice appreciate "

UPDATE: My mom isn’t going to be home tomorrow, so I will have the phone by my side if he shows up. I don’t want to play around and risk getting me, my fiancé or my mom hurt. After discussing it with her, she says she doesn’t want to take it that far, but she thinks too positive. So I’m taking it into my own hands for the safety of all of us. Thank you all so much for the advice. It helped me more than I can say. 

This guy, we will call him Ricky.. was my dad’s best friend. He would hang out with us every now and then, but didn’t come around very much. Him and my dad have gotten into fist fights over Ricky’s awful behavior towards my mom and our other female family members. So he stopped coming around. 

My dad passed away earlier this year, and Ricky took it upon himself to come to my house and ask my mom out shortly after he passed. Completely insensitive and just an awful thing to do. My mom was too nice to tell him to shove it, so she laughs it off and says “No thanks”.

Well... ever since, Ricky has come up here almost every single day. He will beat on our door for a whole minute, then if we don’t answer.. he sits on our porch and waits. He has waited for a whole hour before. One time, I was home alone and when I didn’t answer the door, he walked over to my dad’s truck and started rummaging through the back of it, took a piss on it, and left. He is waiting on my porch right now as I type this. My mom isn’t home, and I’m pretty sure he saw her leave so I don’t know why he is still here. I want to call the cops and potentially get a restraining order, because he is always v e r y drunk and won’t leave us alone. I just wish my dad was here to tell him to fuck off and leave my poor mom alone. I just need advice, because I feel like I’m a prisoner who has to stay silent when he comes around so that he won’t think we are home. 

Edit: my mom is very afraid of confrontation due to this guys drinking habits, and would rather stay silent and not answer the door instead of telling him to leave us alone. That’s why I’m stuck right now. "

That morning i went to police and their advice was just toss it (she had our two youngest girls 4 and 2 in the bed with  her) i went home took the bag out, and calmly asked her what it was. Things exploded soon after, i was reading to the girls and she attacked me to get it out of my pocket ripping my pants and pushing me around i ran to the car drove around the block and called the police. They came and took the meth (they later tested it and told me it was meth) and her to jail for domestic battery in the presence of a child.

Hey guys, so me and my fiance have been together for a few years and we're in our 20s. No major problems the whole time.  


However, last night she went to some friends' house after work and invited me over, but I ended up working late. I show up 4 hours or so later and it turns out she had just been in another room making out with someone she met briefly a long time ago when we were still together (who she kind of liked at the time). He initiated it and she kissed him back, they made out for 5 minutes or so, and he was touching her over the pants but she didn't touch him at all back.  


She deeply regrets it, and immediately told me about it, unprovoked. She had been extremely drunk at the time, but I still feel alcohol doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't already do, it just makes it easier. She never really had a chance in her teens to go crazy and date people, go on crazy adventures, travel, etc. and I understand it's hard getting into a long term / serious relationship so young. She was 100% honest and transparent about every detail, even things I never had any way of finding out.  


What is your guys take? It would already be over with, in my opinion, if it had only been a short kiss. She says she never would have done it normally, but that her head was all fuzzy and it was a random and exciting unexpected event and she just went with it. She also said she wants to say she'd never do anything like that in the future, but is not 100% sure because apparently she's capable of it when she drinks like that.

When I was in 10th grade (Sophomore for the Americans if any are reading this) I got incredibly ill with a mental illness. I was hospitalised twice towards the end of the year. I missed my year 10 graduation due to being in hospital. Despite all this I managed to top 3 of my classes for the year. My illness progressively got worse, but I started yr 11 (Junior) at a new school to get a new start. I have been an A student my whole life. Now, my brain functioning was suffering from malnourishment, I couldn’t remember things and would space out a lot. So I started year 11, (toped Advanced Eng for the term) and then landed my ass back in hospital worse then ever. I spent a month in hospital before being sent to a specialised centre, where I spent 5 weeks. I got out, and was still recovering so there was no way I could go to school. I then ended up back in hospital (the 3rd time that year) for 6 weeks. When I got out, I was sick and tired of being told I was stupid and all that fun stuff. Everyone else I knew, all of my friends, my only friends, where stressing about exams and parties and school gossip, while I sat in a hospital bed. Towards the end of last year, I got better, so went back to school, but as I had missed out in so much of yr 11, they put me back into yr 10 for the last few weeks of the year. I knew I had to repeat yr 11, which for me was heartbreaking. My disease had taken so much from me, my friends, my life, and now my dignity. I was always that kid who people said was going to go places, I studied hard, I loved school and learning, I still do. I held myself at such a high standard that my school work had to be perfect. But I couldn’t because my brain and body couldn’t handle it. So, at the start of this year, I started yr 11. Again. I subsequently ended up back in hospital, where I spent 3  1/2 weeks. During this time, I kept up my schooling online, and put my education above my recovery. When I got home, I feel right back into bad habits and couldn’t handle school. Flash forward to now, I’ve cried and grieved and tried to come to terms with the fact that it is likely I won’t ever have the experience and education I dreamed of: I won’t complete my HSC and get an ATAR. My sister is in yr 9, and I help her with her assignments, I also tutor another young girl. I love learning, and helping with my sister’s assignments is so thrilling, but I do not have the physical capability to go to school 5x a week for 6 hrs everyday. My boyfriend is in yr 12, (where I should be) and I have helped him with his assignments and had so much fun, and loved helping him study for his final exams. But now, all of my friends are graduating, celebrating 13 years of schooling. The kids who smoked weed and skipped class and bullied people and hated school, have graduated. And I, someone who loves learning and school, am a high school drop out. I hate myself so much for all of this, for being so jealous of my friends, for hating my body and the fact that I can’t go to school, the fact that I feel like I am incapable of schooling, i feel like my identity has been stripped from me. 

I’m really sorry this is so long. I don’t really now what I’m doing. I guess the gist is, I’m not graduating and I’m jealous and sad and angry at myself. But I want to be happy for my friends, but every time I see them or they mention it it feels like I’m being stabbed.

Edit: HOLY SHOT. I did not expect anyone to reply, so this is mind blowing. I’m trying to answer as many comments as I can, but thank you all so very much for your advice. I feel so much better about the whole situation now. Thank you all so much for sharing your advice and stories with me, I appreciate it to no end."

I recently got a job at a fast food place and I've been super surprised by how weird people are being about it! 

Context: I just graduated from a top ten university with distinction, and landed a full-time teaching gig at one of the most elite high schools in the nation. I plan on attending medical school, some form of grad school for sure, and am therefore saving money like there's no tomorrow. 

I walked into this fast food place and saw they were hiring. Asked for an application. After hearing about my background, the hiring manager seemed genuinely baffled, asking why I would want to work there. I was caught off guard, I blurted out the truth: I need money for grad school! This seemed to satisfy her, and I got the job :) 

After telling one of my friends, however, he seemed genuinely concerned, saying there are much ""better"" ways for me to make the money that ""make more sense."" 

That hurt my feelings-I wanted to share what I felt like was a huge success with my friends. I had found a place that was willing to let me work part-time, around my full-time schedule, with weekends off. What more could I ask for? Sure, the uniforms are tacky, but what fast-food place's uniforms aren't? 

He made the point that my second job is literally two minutes walking distance from my first one (which is why I picked it) and wouldn't I be embarrassed if my coworkers saw me working there? 

Now I'm second-thinking things and more than a little confused. My parents are immigrants, my dad is now a respected physician, but things weren't always that way. He had to work fast food jobs himself to make ends meet, and didn't have a car, so his boss would have to pick him up for shifts sometimes. We used to make a game over who could pick up the most change off the floor at the grocery store. 

Basically, I've never, ever seen an honest dollar as something to be ashamed of. But now I'm worried. Are my coworkers going to think differently of me? Am I jeopardizing my first really, really great job that I'm passionate about and SO lucky to have landed? Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal?? Should I look for a different second job like tutoring or something? "

What do I do about this? *Added TLDR and edit to the bottom*

My neighbor is a 20 year old girl. Last week the police were called on her because she was caught by another neighbor beating the absolute fuck out of her dog and screaming at it. The cops wrote up a report but otherwise did nothing, and a few people in the complex including myself were discussing calling the ASPCA on her next time we saw anything fucked up happen.

Well last night I get home at 2am from work and she asks me if I have a phone charger, she needs to call a vet because something is seriously wrong with her dog. I tell her I’m coming up and I go up to see the dog. His back legs are completely paralyzed, he’s covered in his own piss and shit, and his asshole was basically inside out. He was very awake and alert and clearly super uncomfortable. I scooped him up and told her I was taking him to my apartment to wash him off, she told me he had been like that for about 3 DAYS.

I brought this poor thing back to my apartment, laid him in the bath, and washed him off. He was so caked in his own fucking body fluid that I had to shampoo him twice to get it all out. My hands were shaking for hours and I bawled my fucking eyes out over him for 20 minutes while I cleaned him up, it was so hard watching him trying and trying to get up. I wrapped him up in a towel and laid him on some comfy pillows and talked to our other neighbor and he drove us all to the vet (me, my boyfriend, her, and the other guys wife all went.)

While she was inside we all basically agreed that she would either put the dog through surgery or put him down. If she tried to have the dog released we would not drive her home. She tried to release the dog and we told her to go right the fuck back inside and put him down. She argued that if she did that she would be lonely at her apartment blah blah blah but we were firm about it. 

She had him put down. He had a herniated disc in his back, probably from being kicked so hard the other day. She killed this fucking dog and we all know it. He was only 2.

I let the front desk at the vet know that she had been abusing it and she said there was nothing they could do about that. I asked her who I could call regarding it and she said I could call the police but they likely won’t do anything about it, like they brushed it off the first time too. Since the dog is gone we don’t have any physical proof of it anymore. And the police out here are notoriously useless. We tried calling ASPCA last night but nobody was answering, and now there’s no dog to call about. Who do I go to about this? What can I do to make sure she doesn’t get away with it? We’ve reported it to the property manager and he’s discussing getting her evicted with the landlord. Also we live in Las Vegas NV, zip code is 89101 if that helps.

Thank you for reading. All advice appreciated.

TL;DR: my neighbor beat her dog and it had to be put down 3 days later after becoming paralyzed from the waist down from a herniated disc. Want to report her but not sure what I can do now that the evidence is gone.

EDIT: answering some repeated stuff.

1.) I didn’t know she beat the dog until the day before this. I should’ve called animal control the next morning but I didn’t and I’m really mad at myself for it.
2.) She does not have any kids, fortunately.
3.) She does not have any other pets, but made mention of getting a cat, so I’m keeping an eye out
4.) the landlord is currently not doing anything but I believe she’s trying to see what she can do.
5.) if you are hear to suggest that she get a fish or hamster instead you’re wrong. If you’re here to suggest that maybe she’s just not a dog person, fuck you. She killed an animal. It’s not that simple.

Please help. Long story, short...My wife has stuck by me through sickness and health, good times and bad, for richer and for poorer. Right now, we’re poorer. But, I have saved just over $100 so that we don’t have to do “nothing” for our 20th Anniversary.  We live in a major city, so there are plenty of options for me to either take her somewhere, make her something, buy something or just do something for our anniversary. But I want to make sure I get the most bang for the buck. Suggestions?

Edit: Thanks to everyone who gave me ideas. I plan on combining several of these, next week. Starting the day with our song and a jar full of hearts with reasons that I love her. A photo book of our last 20 years and making a wonderful dinner with some living room dancing to end our day.  Virtually overnight you have all helped tremendously. I will update next week to let you know how it goes. Thank you!!

Last Edit: Today is the day and I need to say “Thank You” to the Reddit community! It’s only 8:45 in the morning and this was a complete success. Last night, while she slept, I used post it notes to write reasons that I love her and stick them all around our house ($0.00).  When she woke up and found them, I used my Alexa app to play our song through our Echo ($1.99 song purchase). We danced while the song played, then I gave her the photo book I ordered online ($35.00ish because I did a horrible job trying to apply the correct coupon).  She loved it!  She said it was a perfect Anniversary. I planned on cooking tonight, but she had been holding on to a gift card from The Cheesecake Factory, for tonight.  So, that and the money I have left over will allow us to have a nice dinner.  Pay day is Friday.  So, we’ll be OK.  But, you all have helped me make this day, when money was tight, special.  Thank you all for your suggestions!!!!"

I wouldn’t have believed her except that her dad forced her to wear a really revealing outfit, put glitter on her chest, and she had bruises on her shins from where she was kicked. She told me her dad’s involved in a gang, not surprising since our area has a lot of addicts. She said that she was taken to a wear house. There were a bunch of other older men there and girls her age. (She said they were getting high and i don’t blame them) She was forced to flirt with older men by her dad, and I don’t think she was raped, but still. It could happen if she stays in this position? The point is, what should I do to help her get out of this position. Who do I contact first? i don’t want her to get in trouble with police or her dad. 

edit: I’m a 17 y/o girl and would also like to keep myself safe and anonymous 

UPDATE: i’ve told the councilor and given a statement to the police, they’ll handle it from here. there’s not much i can do about it now. i feel a little silly because i don’t know her well, and telling someone irl sounds so ridiculous. hopefully, she might just be making this up? but i don’t believe so. 

MAJOR UPDATE: she found out it was me who reported her, she’s not mad, but she asked me not to do it again. whatever, like i said i barely know her. she told me though that she lied to the councilor and said everything was fine. i’m honestly pretty mad at her, because she has to do something! i can’t do it for her.

MINOR UPDATE: i forgot to mention, but the school has given her several three hour detentions and in-school suspensions for skipping class and dresscode violations for wearing the clothes her dad made her wear. she said one teacher came up behind her and cut the flowy piece of fabric hanging off her romper. i’m mad that she’s being treated this way, she obviously needs help, and of course they didn’t know about her situation but now they do. anyways, what do y’all thing?"

What do we do? First of all not sure if this belongs here but didn’t know where.

Last night, 3am pst, I got woken up to my nephew screaming. He was freaking out that he was surrounded by bugs and spiders. My sister said he woke up at 10:30pm from a stomach ache and threw up.

He didn’t have a fever so I called he nurse helpline and they said to bring him to the er. As soon as we got to the hospital the hallucinations subsided but he started getting all fidgety and neurotic.

Immediately I thought he looked like a meth head all twitchy, stuttering.... nurse and doctor sent out for urine and blood test and he came back positive for methamphetamine (something about both that it’s not just the kind found in adderal or Ritalin).

I don’t know what to do, my sister said she has nothing like that in her home however I don’t trust her. But I also know CPS is scary and can possibly latch onto anything, so I don’t want to not stand by her if I have no evidence. She works for the county and keep applying for other jobs and days she is being drug tested....or so I think.

There’s two houses in the property I live in the front my parents and she lives in the back with him and his 8 yr. old brother.

My older brother used to use so maybe he left some at my sisters or gave her some and she uses??? I’m so crazed, poor little guy doesn’t deserve this

It’s also Halloween time and he has already gone trick or treating at this neighborhood lake so idk if he was possibly exposed via candy.

Tl;dr: nephew had hallucinations, anxious, tested positive for meth. Not sure if I believe my sister but also don’t want him taken away.

Anyone else ever deal with something like this? I know cps will be notified. I’m worried about him as we’re in the hospital as he’s coming down. 




Edit: I should’ve noted that I have no proof my sister uses meth, I have never seen er take any drugs beyond weed. I don’t trust her because I think she’s lazy and had two kids that my parents help support because she didn’t want to be a mom.
So yeah I dont know if she is a junkie I’m just worried and don’t know how to react.

Update: so when I wrote my nephew was being released I was out getting a spare change of clothes by the time I got back he was back with hallucinations and was not let go. He is staying overnight but everyone says he is doing well, he is a trooper although as of 7pm he (&amp; i) had not slept except a couple hours since the normal sun-mon night sleep. So I’m tired but he is fighting sleep even tho he was given lots of adavan and Benadryl. 
Cps and cops stopped by her/my house interviewed everyone along with neighbors, babysitter, and teachers. Sister has to get tested tomorrow. Found out he did have chocolate from the trick or treat bag before going to bed, cops took the candy to test just in case. Did had legal questions regarding HIPPA and property access so I crossposted. I’m tired and still don’t know what to think about my sister I hope she isn’t a closeted junkie however statistically speaking it does not look good."

I’ve had problems with a coworker— nothing major, just little annoying digs— but one issue is getting pretty bad. No matter what we talk about, in what context, it always seems to cycle back to her being sexually assaulted. It’s a horrific act, I know, life changing and can be all consuming. I had been assaulted in the past too. But when we’re at work, trying to code and look at spreadsheets and do work, constantly talking about rape feels like a shock or a big slap in the face. It’s a combo of me not wanting to think about my own experiences, not wanting to be her therapist, and it making it much more difficult to get back into the zone of working. It isn’t aimed directly at me, but when you have a tiny team and she says it to the group it hits everyone. But there’s no way you can say “stop talking about being raped, I’m trying to work.” I have no idea what to do. So far I just kind of awkwardly ignore it and try to keep working. Any advice?"

Throwaway account just in case.

Last year I joined a psychology/typology discord server because I was learning about it and getting interested in that stuff. I quickly made friends with several people and started talking to them more and more until recently. And over the past few months I just haven't cared about that stuff at all because I've been trying to focus on myself more and changing things about me, which left me with no shared interests with any of the friends I made. I should note that most of those people I convinced myself not to care about because of things I've learned about them or things they've done that I don't agree with, etc. There are a couple that I still cared about and that's the ones I feel kinda bad for.

I'm also the type of person where I believe friendships go both ways. One person can't put in all of the work - which is what I felt like I was doing. I get that people have lives and such, but that never stopped me from sending someone a message to see how they were and what they were up to or replying when they did seldom message me. Just talking in general. And not very many people ever did that with me which made me not want to care or be friends with them.

So I typed up a goodbye message and posted it in the server and left. And part of me is relieved to be gone and part of me is saying I made a mistake. I know for a fact that a few of those people talked about me in private channels or between each other. I'm not sure why or what about, I never figured that part out. I was nice and got along with everyone that I knew of.

I haven't cut many people out of my life before because once I make friends with someone, I want to hold on to that relationship. I don't take them lightly so this is just bothering me and I know I'm rambling here too.

I don't know what I'm posting this for. I guess I just want to see if anyone else ever felt like they made a wrong choice when they cut people out and if it actually worked our for the best or not. I hope I made the right choice in leaving and cutting out those people in my life and trying to move on. I guess I can always find more discord servers to be apart of and make more friends online.

Thanks for reading.


Edit: Wow at the responses! This blew up. Thanks to everyone who commented. I read every single one (and will continue to do so). You've all helped me realize I'm making the right choice so thank you for doing so."

The problem is, he's married and my mom even knows his wife (7 years together). They've been going out for about a month but she just told me.

Anybody know Polish?"" The old story:

So heres an old post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend\_20m\_cheating\_anybody\_know\_polish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vf1ki/boyfriend_20m_cheating_anybody_know_polish/)

of me asking if anyone could help me out translating my boyfriends messages because i thought he might be cheating. and just... wow... I checked on the post the next day and it had 2 responses, so I just left it alone after that not checking again until now (1 week later). I want to thank  [raygarraty47](https://www.reddit.com/user/raygarraty47) and  [Morex\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Morex_) especially for putting in all that work translating everything, thank you so much!

The update:

Not knowing the whole translation yet, and only going by the ""I love you"" message he send her, I waited for him to wake up from his alarm clock at 7, not having slept all night, and told him to tell me everything. Well he didn't lie, he told me he was in love with this female friend of his, and that he told her last night, but she didn't like him back, she liked his friend (who in turn didn't like her). I asked him if he still loved me, and he said no. So that evening when meeting him after a busy day and thinking about it, I broke things off. It was incredibly painful and I pretty much died from sadness, after some talking he started crying as well, and told me he did still love me, he was just trying to suppress it because I had been homesick for my country and talked a lot about going back and he couldn't bear losing me.  But he was right, I did wanna go back, so despite that we stayed broken up. 4 days ago I moved out of his apartment into a little empty dorm room a super sweet girl is lending me now that she's home for the summer. And my mom will picking me up next Sunday to take the long drive back home.

Reading the translated messages now, it's odd, but comforting. There's nothing new in there he was still hiding from me, except just how in love he is with this girl, I'm pretty sure she was supposed to be some sort of ""replacement"" for when I would leave, he either denies this, or doesn't realize where his own feelings come from. We're parting on good terms, although it still hurts a lot. I understand you cannot control what you feel (although I'm concerned that If she would've liked him, he might've started full blown cheating. But there's no use worrying about that now). And I also understand I shouldn't have told him of my plans to leave without actually going through with it, leaving him in that uncertainty. 

So that's where I am, heartbroken and lonely until the moment my mom picks me up, when I will just be heartbroken. But also with this whole issue behind me, and a new life ahead in the country I love with my family and friends.

Another employee has already said that if I got promoted, he would make my life a “living hell.” What can I do to work with him cordially? Additionally, any general advice for a first time manager? I have done nothing in particular to upset him. We both applied for this position, and they didn’t even interview him. I can only imagine that’s what it is, as I’ve done nothing else to him. We’ve always had good conversation and been nice to each other, so I’m really not sure where this is coming from. 

I am wary of telling upper management; if it got back to him that I reported that, he would know exactly which employee told me he said it. I don’t want to start this new position off in a heap of drama. We is also really well liked by upper management. 25% of his position is spent working right under the director, so I imagine he would never ever be reprimanded. We have only ever fired one person, and it was because she showed up high as a kite not once, not twice, but three times. And if anyone is going to get away with insubordination, it would be him. 

He also refuses to do specific job duties (trying to be vague for privacy). He has decided he doesn’t like them and so he won’t do them. That would be alright if he did other duties in its place, but he doesn’t. He disappears for 10-15 minutes at a time. Sometimes he disappears with another coworker, sometimes alone. It’s always to get coffee or something, but that’s not far from our offices.

I don’t want to start off on the wrong foot with him. I don’t have the option of writing up or suspending (that’s upper management, which again, wouldn’t do either of those things). I’m concerned about starting my first management job with an employee who is already dedicated to making my life hell. 

I’d appreciate any advice there. I’d also appreciate any general advice for a first time manager! I’m very nervous, and I want to make sure my employees are well taken care of, treated fairly, and happy."

I heard some of his friends teasing him about it and I did some digging and I asked some of his friends and they told me that he’s gonna marry a 14 year old in 3 weeks. I immediately got butterflies in my stomach and after that I did some investigating and found his bride, Naima. I just found out that she’s one of my friend’s cousins and he told me that he’s not happy about what Rajeet is doing. He tried to file a police report last week but they refused him since it’s for their religion and they have no control over that. 

This is why I hate the justice system in India since it let’s Monsters marry little girls and eventually molest then and ruin their lives. I don’t know how to tackle this situation at this point since I don’t want Naima to get married at AGE 14. She can’t even consent to something like that and she’s in secondary school.

Is there anything we can do to take action against him? Today was my roommate's first dermatology appointment ever in America and she came home SOBBING. She has pretty severe eczema and was quite excited about finally seeing a new dermatologist and getting her condition under control again. She chose this dermatologist because he has a private practice and is covered under our school's insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate had eczema all her life and has tried nearly every medication under the sun. When this doctor began recommending her medications, she asked if there were other options because the ones he recommended she had already tried and she had an extremely terrible reaction to. He was very condescending, asking her""Did you go to medical school?"" All she was trying to do was find a medication option that worked with her lifestyle and condition, yet this doctor told her she wasn't a doctor and that she needed to compromise. This is the kicker: he had the AUDACITY to tell her ""if I had eczema as bad as yours I would lock myself up and not see anyone."" At this point she began crying very hard, to which the doctor just reacted by leaving the room. He came back later, asking ""have we calmed down?"" without a  single apology. Her eczema was already a source of insecurity, I thought it was absolutely unprofessional and fucked up for this doctor to tell her such a thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Just writing this is making my blood boil. She had never had this kind of rude and unprofessional experience with a doctor so she just left sobbing without saying anything. Is there anything we can do to about this situation? He has a private practice, but is there anyone or any other organization we can report him to?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all your advice. We are still looking into organizations to report him to (AAD and BBB), but we will most definitely be writing to our state's Board of Medicine. Also, for everyone saying they would write a review, thank you so much for your sentiments. It is a sweet and touching gesture but I will not be PMing anyone the doctor's information."

But when do you start investing into their future in terms of their ambitions? If a 10yr old wants to make the NBA, should you start looking into private coaching / tournaments or if a 12yr old wants to be a doctor should you start helping her take classes, talk to doctors, and help them take more time out of their lives to gain knowledge/experience in their future vocational desires?

This isn't a new thing either I was very sick when I was younger and past records show I've been complaining since I was 12.

I’m a clinical laboratory scientist at a large lab company, and I do some STD/HIV testing along with other blood tests. I’ve been at my job for a few years and I never call in sick. I work hard and extremely efficiently. I get shit done, and on time. I’ve worked extra days, I’m helpful, I do everything I can to make sure everything is done and people are happy. I’ve only received excellent reviews. 

So, in my home life, my cooking skills get like maybe 2 stars. I had a bit of a cooking accident that resulted in a grease fire. I sustained second degree burns to a decent portion of my dominant hand. I went to the ER and got a note for 2 days off and a referral to a burn clinic. I didn’t take the days off, and went to work the next day thinking I could tough it out and then see what the burn clinic said the next day. Bad idea. The burn specialist doctor said I needed a month off work and wrote me a work note. 

I went into work the day after burn clinic, and thinking I’m being generous, I ask for just a week of that month off. I get told no. I say “I’m afraid the sweaty, moist environment of the XL gloves I can barely fit over my bandages may contribute to a greater likelihood of infection in my already vulnerable wounds.” 

No. 

I say “this really, really hurts and I’m doing too much with my hand.” 

Nope. There’s no one else at our facility trained to do my job.

I feel so used and abused. I get paid absolute shit. We’ve had other labs in the same company send us their samples for me to run because the only person they had to run those tests was on vacation, but this can’t be done for me during an infection prone injury? 

I was about to cry, as I had already scraped one of my finger burns while trying to get a bottle of machine wash fluid out of the cardboard box. I’m so frustrated and hurt that I’m being forced to work in pain and in conditions that make me more prone to infection. And with disease ridden blood samples. That this company thinks so little of me that they can ignore my concerns, my doctor’s concerns, and put me in danger of infection, surgery, and more unnecessary and undue stress. I feel so unappreciated. I know they could find a way to figure this out. I just don’t know what to do. 

I know I could apply for short term disability, but I’m afraid of retaliation from my supervisor for doing so. I guess I could make 60% pay work, not easily. I kind of feel like a whiney bitch because I made it through those work days (in a LOT of pain and using my hand WAY more than advised) so surely I can just tough out the rest, but people keep telling me “no, you’re being a bitch for not standing up for yourself.” I don’t know what to do.

I’ll take advice. I know I need to find a new job real soon. Thanks for reading. 

To;dr: Obviously can’t just quit job because money. My main concern is retaliation if I take short term disability after my boss said no to a month (then week at my suggestion) off. Excellent employee, feel a weird sense of obligation because I’m the only person who can do my job, but supervisor denied medical leave.
Know I need a new job.

Edit: in Texas, USA, worked there full time over 3 years, VERY large company.

UPDATE: Got set up on FMLA. The next day, my boss asks if I can come in and train someone on my bench. I say “no, I’m on FMLA and short term disability.” And told him to contact HR. I contacted HR and let them know he was asking me to work, and they said they would let him know that my doctor’s note said no work until certain date.

He then says he will put my hours worked for that day training someone on last week so that we can keep my FMLA the same. He was pressuring me saying “we need to get someone trained so we don’t fall behind.”  I know that crap isn’t legal, so I said my doctor said I can’t work, sorry. 

I knew I’d get harassed if I took FMLA. This job has let me work with an infection prone injury without a glove, promised me a lab assistant to assist me and didn’t deliver, and asked me to work without clocking in so they could put my hours on last week, basically causing insurance fraud because of my short term disability. This company has over 60,000 employees and they can’t find one that can do my job? Right...

But I got it done! Now time to go to occupational therapy and such."

Before I start I was eventually let go not because they thought it was just a misunderstanding but because 5 dollars wasn't worth the paper work so they told me not to steal again. 

I went to the self check out with literally $4.99 worth of food. I put in my credit card. It said to remove it. And then there was an error screen. I assumed it went through. I told an employee about the error screen and then walked out. 

An employee stopped me. I asked if it went through and he asked me to come with him. I said if it didn't go through then I would gladly pay for it. He brought me to a back room.

I tried telling them multiple times that if it didn't go through I would pay for it. But this one guy kept talking to me like some parent to thier disobedient teen. It hurt honestly. He said things like, ""You knew what you were doing and you were stealing"" and rolling his eyes at me.

After about 20 minutes they decided it wasn't worth the effort since the amount was so small.

I should add that after I paid for these items I put them in my purse. Just because they fit and I try not to use plastic bags. So I don't blame them for thinking I stole something. 

They didn't let me use my phone. After I left I checked my phone and I had a text message from my bank telling me that 4.99 was pulled from my account about 20 minutes earlier(my bank texts me everytime I purchase something more than a dollar that I didn't think of when I was back there)The time I paid for the items.

So I have it on bank record that it was pulled out and I could probably print it off.

Honestly I want to do something because now they have my ID in the system and if for whatever reason this happens again I'm screwed. I'm just so upset that I had no opportunity to prove my innocence and at the way I was treated. I just feel like this is unfair as I didn't do anything wrong.

Is there anything I can do?"

You can’t have your dogs out between dusk and dawn. All night you can hear coyotes snarling and howling at something they’ve found. My mom has already lost three dogs to coyotes.

We have a front yard with a fence that her dog Cindy can fit through to go out into the dessert alone, and she does whenever she can. To prevent her from doing this, you either need to supervise her while she’s out in the courtyard, or put a big pillow on her so she can’t fit through the bars if she tries. Everyone in the family knows this as it has been the charade for years and years.

For months now, Cindy has been found randomly outside roaming during prime coyote hours which are dusk and dawn way too often. It seems to happen three or four times a week. No one has been able to figure out what is going on. Each time she has had her pillow on too, which makes it even weirder. 

One morning I was out on the porch hidden from view to anyone going outside, but easily seen by anyone coming in. I saw my dad come out, walk over to the gate, open it slightly and look around, and then very gently close it so it didn’t latch. To me it looked very deliberate to make sure the gate was not closed and could be opened by pushing. On his way back he saw me, said hi, and then went inside. 

Seconds later, the door reopened and out came my mom’s dog with her pillow on. She systematically walked straight to the gate, bumped it, and went right outside. It seems like a ritual event. I immediately went outside and grabbed her and latched the gate closed.

My opinion somewhat permanently changed of my dad when I saw that. It really scared me and still does. It just seems so callous and disturbing.

For Christmas we decided to get my mom this special vest with spikes on it that she could simply leave on Cindy at all times and then it wouldn’t matter if she was left outside. It would pierce the coyotes’ mouths at first bite attempt and they would leave her alone. We all kinda knew that my dad would hate that gift but we didn’t care. It solved the problem.

Ever since Christmas, the vest has been working great, and my dad is livid. He says he thinks it’s ugly and he can never pet her with it on. He keeps taking it off and hiding it the house, and then blaming my mom that she lost it. We find it in the oddest places, like in closets. 

Today, we found out that Cindy got out and bit our neighbor. My dad says that she simply can never be allowed outside the gate again, and we all agree with him.

The problem is, he is now stating that since she’s not allowed outside the gate, *we need to now send the vest back as it is no longer needed*. My mom is also telling me that the situation is extremely strenuous and is affecting their marriage.

Do I just give up and send back the vest? Am I under any civic duty to protect this dog, which would be at the apparent expense of the relationship with my dad?

TL;DR My dad doesn’t like my mom’s dog Cindy so he lets her outside on purpose where there are coyotes when nobody’s watching. I bought a vest that protects Cindy from coyotes but now my dad is demanding we send it back and it’s affecting our family’s relationship. If I give up the argument Cindy will probably get eaten. Help. 

EDIT: Progress https://i.imgur.com/IfYvc9i.jpg

EDIT 2: My dad is more fucked up than I thought. Thanks for all the feedback. Vest is staying at home so Cindy should be safe. I’ll check with my mom to make sure she isn’t still getting out. If she says she gets out still, I’ll figure out how to film it. And I am going to distance myself from my father :("

   One topic that came up a lot was aliens and other anomalies. At first, I thought that he was just talking about the usual stuff like UFO’s, which I had believed in. He then spoke about other conspiracies such as “9-11 never happened and everyone was brainwashed” and “Aliens made the pyramids”.

   All the evidence was extremely dumb and unconvincing such as “there are no movies about a flat Earth, so it must be flat” and “satellites images and satellites in general are fake because we can’t see them” (yes these are actual arguments that YouTube videos had told him and that he believes).

I know this is taking a toll on me physically and mentally. My memory is getting worse, I feel sad all the time, i’m out of shape and my vision has gotten a lot worse.   
I have so many things I really really want to do. 

I *want* to learn how to play musical instruments. I have so many different instruments because I always thought “maybe i’ll be motivated to play **this** instead”, got them 6-7 years ago, but “never had the time” to try. 

I *want* to learn to skateboard. I used to have so much fun on them when i was younger. I put good money into this, I built my own board but still, “haven’t had time.” i’ve barely touched the board since.

I *want* to learn to drive. That’s right, I never learned to drive and it’s embarrassing. This makes it difficult to go home or do things as an independent “adult”.

I *want* to create more artwork (I love drawing) but never get around to it. I used to be able to knock out a photo-realistic piece in a day or two but now it takes me months to do one piece.  I especially want to get into SFX makeup and go to school for that. Hopefully make it a profitable hobby one day. 

I’m in college now (3rd year undergrad) and I have failed many of my classes because I can’t find energy or motivation to study until the very last minute. 
The worse my GPA gets, the more worthless I feel and the more I think “what’s the point? I don’t deserve to be here”. 
I didn’t get accepted into the engineering program as a 1st year and ever since then, I think I just gave up. Instead of working hard and improving my grades and GPA to reapply, I got lazy. I felt dumb and I just moved away from my family so I was scared and alone. I just didn’t try. 
I was a 1st generation and I was lost and unhappy and didn’t have a good advisor (all my advisors had quit). 
I would skip my exams and classes. Looking back, I have no idea why i would ever do that to myself. I’ve always enjoyed learning in high school. Still to this day, when I do actually put in some study hours and feel like i’m learning, it’s makes me happy. I enjoy it. I wish I could go back and fix everything I did to hurt my record. 
 
I want to get into lab research and shadowing (ideally, i want to be a biomedical engineer with an MD-PhD. I’ve switched my major many times trying to find easy things but nothing made me happy). but of course I never get around to writing a CV or applying or looking into the positions on my campus. I don’t have a great resume at this point and I guess I don’t see the point of trying to get into labs because no one is going to want a lazy, worthless child working with/for them. 

I have a lot of things I *want* to do, but “want” doesn’t seem to be enough. I literally cannot find energy or motivation or inspiration. I’m completely ashamed of myself. I’m embarrassed when people ask about me or what i’m up to. 
I guess I don’t know what to do and I need some advice. I want to fix my life. I genuinely enjoy getting things done and having a set schedule, but for some reason I’m stuck. Even when I set schedules, I don’t end up following them for longer than a week. 
I want to be proud of myself and what i’m doing. I want to be happy. I want to do things. Literally any advice or thoughts or comments at all will be helpful.

Considering going back and checking on how she's doing. Would this be weird? I delivered a pizza to a lady almost a week ago. I asked her how she was doing, and she told me that someone committed suicide and she lost someone else close to her. I was considering taking a pizza and going back to her just to ask how she's doing. However, I'm a pretty socially awkward person and tend to keep to myself and I'm not sure if it would be received as weird if I did go back or not. Would love some advice on this.

Edit: So I ended up going. I bought a pizza after work and took it to her address. I kept my work uniform on just so it's a little less weird. She seemed a little surprised, but I told her that I just wanted to see how she was doing since she seemed like she was going through a rough time last week. She didn't look as down as she did last time, she looked normal. Anyways, she took the pizza and said thank you. I'm not sure how she genuinely took it, but I'm hoping that she saw it as the kind gesture that it was intended to be.

Thank you for all responses. I will get back to everyone if I can, all is very appreciated! 

I caught the virus and have had zero appetite and can not even taste food or smell. I see it as a good thing because I am not as skinny as I used to be having grown into my womanly body. I am 27. 

For the past few days I have grazed here and there just to try to feel a bit more strong. Any time I do I feel super gross and guilty. I have been feeling it coming on even before, just guilt over eating and wanting my old body back. It has been triggering seeing how skinnny my bf’s sister is and other girls. I am naturally curvier, I’d say “skinny fat” as in not petite but not thick. People comment on my big calves that aren’t in proportion to the rest of me and I want them gone.

I hate my body and I finally had a real plate of food after 4 days and I feel so gross because I didn’t have to eat, a lot of people fast and this is perfect timing as no appetite. I only lost a few lbs too. How can I stop beating myself up over eating? Also, it is a new thing for me to be super grossed out to be around other people who are eating. I don’t mean to be a jerk, I just can’t stomach it. 

I am 5’2 at best and weigh 110lbs at my average. When I am skinny I am 100 lbs. I do not look down on others for their body, just myself. I can see this spiraling out of control quickly as I have an urge to throw up my food now and even be proAna. I was as a teenager and my weight has fluctuated a lot. If there is a workout I can do to burn the calories I just ate, even though I am sick, I will do that instead. 

This is my mindset and even a few weeks ago I did not want to eat, but my bf encouraged it. I over-ate. It’s gross but I have been happy about some of my stomach flu like symptoms of the virus, I felt clean and now having food in me feels like a failure. I have also binged a lot in the past and probably would have been bulimic if my body allowed it. My gag reflex is stubborn. 

Help before this gets out of control, this has been coming on this whole past month. I worked hard at going to the gym everyday before it was shut down and eating meals. I feel like fasting is my only option since I have hardly moved in 2 weeks and need to make up for all I ate so far. I get it’s dumb and irrational and I just want to have a nice body that is appreciated.

I am all for fasting, but not if it is going to turn into something deeper. I am trying to reframe my mind before it turns into a bigger problem. I want to be strong and smart and be able to fast but not have these thoughts. 

This feels like the only thing I have control of right now and that is power to me. Surely there is a way to rewire what has quickly evolved in my brain? 

So many little triggers have lead up to now. A few months ago my bf’s dad said “you don’t need to eat ALL” of that when I had a full plate of food. Honestly that is when these thoughts started again, along with hanging out with his sister and seeing her Instagram posts (along with others) she  has the body type I did years ago (she’s 19 and has had an eating disorder). 

All my sisters have been athletes their whole life and I am new to the game. My step dad called me fat recently and said I should not look this way at my age. My old step dad used to restrict food. It took me over a year to go to the gym, even though I payed for it. Because I was so anxious about my body. 

I beat myself up a lot for time lost in getting in shape and being proactive. I was super proud of myself for doing it, even though still beating myself up for years of not pushing myself. Now I feel like all progress is lost because I got sick. Even though I know it is black and white thinking, it is how my brain works. I hope to rewire it (at least I have legs! Etc..) 

Over a year ago his female friend (at the time) commented on my body type in front of table full of people, even though she is much more skinny than me. I was not very hungry and didn’t have an issue at the time, but she says loudly and sarcastically in front of everyone to hear “WOW! You are soooo skinny”. Again she is a lot smaller than me. That moment has been playing along with everything else here. It was so embarrassing. 

The before and after pics of women who lost a lot of weight have been triggering as well bc I think they look a lot better than I do now, even though I never weighed more than 120... they still have smaller legs and chests and prettier faces. I am not naturally attractive and when my face is chubby I have no redemption. When I was 120 my dr at the time said I was overweight 

Idk I just feel like a failure for not working out this whole time and this seems like my only option to catch up. Even though logically I know that would be losing muscle I gained (now lost) at the gym. My brain is not comprehending and I keep crying over having eaten anything other than black coffee. Again I am pro fasting, but haven’t thought like this for so long. If I could just not eat I wouldn’t, but I have a pre existing medical condition that will cause me to faint or have a seizure if I don’t for too long. 

Sorry if this is all over the place, just writing my stream of consciousness as crazy as it sounds. I’ve stopped looking at triggering things and I mute any social media posts that will cause comparison. I see the women who don’t eat as so much stronger than me, and simultaneously the ones who eat normal and lift weights, or are bigger and body positive. 

I got super into baking back in December and my bf bought me an expensive mixer. Sadly I haven’t even opened it because I worried if I got into it I would then get fat (some contestants on British Bake Off joked about gaining weight and it made sense). I shut down that potential passion because of this nagging worry, even though I continued to have days where I’d eat more than I should (just as much pizza and food as my bf, who is chubbier). 

I also worry about getting the body type the women in my family have, which seems mean to think, but I don’t think it would look good on me and my body has already changed so much since being in my “prime”. I think losing my youth and other things I have no control over has onset this too. My male relationships have all been into younger teen looking women and I’m trying to catch up to something I can’t compete with. I naturally have bigger boobs, which I don’t like and want gone because of knowing others preferences. 

I appreciate all body types, just not my own. I don’t want to ruin it by developing something that has irreversible consequences, such as a lowered metabolism. When I was chubby a dr once told me I probably could not exceed 120. The up and down of my weight makes it so my body is not really tight, and that makes me want to lose more even if I am at a good weight."

What to do now? When I was younger, I have a memory of being touched by a close family friend (who is now deceased). He came into my room and rubbed my legs, and I’m not sure if it ever went further. He was one of my grandfathers friends and since that I’ve always felt uncomfortable being around his friends who asked for “hugs.” I always wondered if it was just a made up memory but then I connected it to other memories and things from my childhood. For one, I remember laying naked and touching my sisters on multiple occasions, getting caught by my grandfather once because we hid in the closest to do it one night. We were young, I was probably 6, so they were younger. 

I had almost an obsession with sex, I liked watching sex scenes on TV, and I even had dreams (or maybe I thought it was a dream but it was real). One dream, I remember being in the basement of my house in the laundry room, and laying on the table (where we folded clothes) as a man, pressed something hard between my legs. It felt like I was being dry humped, and I remember the table moving like it was in the ocean. 

When my mother died, my sisters and I moved to a different state, and after that we didn’t engage in that behavior anymore. And since then we’ve all had a great relationship. Over the years, I was assaulted by a man working in a boutique which I never told anyone about. I still see him every time I go to the mall. And I’ve had 11/12 sexual partners since I’ve lost my virginity 3 years ago. I turn 21 in October, and all of this guilt and shame is eating me alive.

I wanted to ask my family do they remember anything happening to me when I was younger, but I don’t know how to even go about doing that."

throwaway account for obvious reasons.

so for the longest time, i had my sister hate me. i never quite understood why. i just thought it was because of her going through her rebellious stage and us not getting along during mine. we have about two years difference in age. She is now pregnant, about to give birth to a kid who the father has decided to not call his, and abandoned her. I'm 21, and my sister is 19.

But about two weeks ago, my brother called me saying that my sister told him why she hates me. she said that when we were younger, that i used to sexually abuse her. she said that i would kiss her and touch her and make her touch me. when he told me this, i felt angry that she would say that about me (she likes to make lies about me to get me in trouble. once told my parents that i was selling drugs). i got angry that he would even believe it, and that she would even say that about me. i got into a huge argument with my brother about it, and we stopped talking. he was very pushy and insistent that i did do it. and in my mind, i knew that i didn't.

Flash forward to last night. she got mad because she couldn't find her charger. she said i took it, and i told her i didn't. she kept pushing, saying that i did, and i just told her that i didn't. she kept forcing me to admit to taking something that i didn't take, and i just told her to ""stop doing that. you like wanting to start fights with me over stupid shit. just fuck off."" i was beyond angry. She then proceeded to tell me that ""why can't you stop being you? do you know why i hate you, it's because of what you did to me as a kid. you're disgusting. sexually abusing little girls. my kid will NEVER call you uncle, and i'm glad that it isn't going to be a little girl. you disgusting fucker."" and it hit me. she actually believes that i abused her. i was frozen because she brought it up to my face. and she was full of pure hatred. and i honestly was in shock.

i walked into my room, and immediately started having a panic attack. what if it was true? what if i actually did it? why can't i remember that? why do i not believe it?

I couldn't wrap my head around the idea. i've always been disgusted at the idea of sexual abuse because a lot of people i care about, have been sexually abused. and i have always hated sexual abusers. and now, here we are. me finding out that i might have been one. i still don't know if i did, because, i couldn't have. i have no memory of any of that that happened. and i kept thinking to myself that maybe i am. and then i started thinking about killing myself. because, i'm disgusting. if i did do what i did, i deserve to die.

i had a knife to my wrist, and i started cutting into my skin when i kept thinking about it.

i just. i don't know how i feel about it all.

I don't remember ever have doing anything like that. I would NEVER do anything like that. But my sister's hate is so pure and real. What if i did do it? I hate myself at the possibility that I did."

I work at a fairly small manufacturing startup company. I have an employee who is trying to get her life back on track.  A few weeks ago she messaged me in a panic, because she no longer had a way to get a work, and her living situation is a mess.  She had a falling out with her partner, which was both where she was living and her only means of getting to work.  Myself and another manager have been giving her a ride when necessary, but it's definitely not sustainable.

A few weeks later, she had to miss work because a family member with whom she was staying domestically assaulted her and she was in the ER   On top of this, she has a young kid who's staying with other family, and she's on the verge of living in a shelter until she can straighten things out.

I'm trying my best to help her. But I feel way out of my league.  What can I do?  What resources are there?  In my previous jobs, I was at a large established company or working for the government  and I knew how to get my employees what they needed in these situations.  But now I feel like I'm in over my head, and I just want to help...

I pretend to be a devout Christian IRL, but I'm actually an Atheist and have been since middle school. 

Growing up, my dad always looked to God for comfort and direction. His faith in God helped him when he was deported from the US, when my mother divorced him, when his father father died, when he was working his ass off to become a lawyer, etc. However, I know that him not being physically there for me when I was growing up always ate away at him. Now, things are piling up on him even more with his country being in the midst of civil unrest and turmoil, the coronavirus pretty much putting the entire world on lockdown, and the increased worry over my safety since I live in the US and my state (Florida) has many cases. Because of this, my dad has been getting very cynical about God and questioning why he would let all of this happen when he could instantly make it better. Since I don't believe in God, I never really considered him at all during this pandemic, but my dad has been doing it constantly. He doesn't know that I don't believe in God and I'm afraid if I tell him now, he'll have the worry of his daughter going to hell always hanging over him. But on the other hand, I think it could help him feel as though he is not alone in doubting his faith.

Have a wonderful day, Reddit!  


\-----

I'm (31F) having these thoughts of purchasing a puppy for 2 months now. I like to consider myself a rational person, and usually, I'm trying my best not to react based on current emotions, that's why I'm having doubts and don't know what to do.

Here's the thing: I usually live between 3 and 6 months in a location, in a rented apartment. I don't have a place of my own. I work from home, allowing myself to travel, that's why the frequent change of places. This thing comes with pros and cons.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

\- new places, different language, different culture

\- I earn enough to have a modest, comfy life, I could/should do better though, no savings yet and that is scary.

\- I have a close friend with who I usually travel but sometimes our lives don't match financially (he earns more than me and it's hard to keep up with him. For example, if he chooses the location and the apartments in that area are OK for him, for me will be expensive. I don't want to waste half of my salary on rent).

&amp;#x200B;

Cons (and the reasons I consider purchasing a puppy):

\- there is no boyfriend in my life, I find it very difficult to find one given my lifestyle

\- no kids, no family, just this friend I have but he has his own thing going on (studies anatomy)

\- I'm feeling depressed most of the time because of my loneliness. I'm ashamed of the fact that I don't have a family by now even though I'm sociable and likable (my past confirms it)

\- because I only spend a few months in a location, I don't feel like integrate much, therefore, I'm not making any friends. All of my friends are in my country.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want a soul only for me to take care and give attention. I'm pretty sporty and active and have enough time to take care of a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

My worries are:

\- it will limit my possibility of evolving financially (spending more time and money on the puppy, not on searching a possibility to make more money or to become knowledgeable about smart investments)

\- no more flights, I would have to travel by car (I don't have one, my friend has one, but maybe we won't live in the same area in the near future. It happened before.)

\- it will limit my rental options

\- I'm scared I'm making a very emotional decision and in the future, I might regret it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I want to buy a puppy because I'm always alone and depressed and I'm thinking that he will improve my life. I'm a sporty girl, I could spend quality time with him. Because I don't have a place of my own, I'm scared of the limitations that a dog might bring me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it will be the right decision to buy a puppy.

Oh, and I'm from Europe. Traveling in cheap countries guys :)"

So when someone started talking about kids and related stuffs, i just get honest and said that i don't want any babies unless they've fur, 4 legs and purr at me. Yeah i admit that i socialize better with animals than human babies. So when people heard my answer, they'll said that i denying human nature, i'm a bad person, it's a sin and many more things that made me cringe and don't want to have babies more.

But it's weird that if someone just push a baby or a toddler at me, i naturally know what to do like change their diapers and so on.

I'm frustrated right now of what people thought of me and worse, my boyfriend love kids and he would always ignore me whenever i tried talking to him about this. I'm ready to be a good wife but not a good mother.

So what do you guys think about this?

I haven’t used Reddit before but because of the situation I thought maybe you could have more insight.

Yesterday I snooped on my wife’s phone because she’s been acting sketchy the last few months. Guarding her phone like a hawk. Turning it over face down when charging. She changed her passcode from a number to a alphanumeric one.

What I found shocked me. She is selling nude photos and feet photos on this site and on Kik. Most of her customers appear to be teenage boys. And not 18,19 either. I’m talking 13,14,15,16,17. Mostly on the lower range.

She is not bothering to verify their ages and I suspect it’s cause she doesn’t care - they’re obviously her biggest customers. Idk how these kids are getting the money but they’re using Venmo, Cash, PayPal and other simile apps to pay her.

Also the money is going into a checking account that I have never heard of. Admittedly I checked her balance cause she had the banks app on her phone and it has close to $7000 in there that she is hiding from me. Although I am more concerned about the fact of who she is selling to.

I took screenshots of everything I found and I texted them to my own phone as evidence.

So yeah apparently I am married to a sex worker who doesn’t care about selling to minors.

My question is should I go to the police or confront her about it? Is this even illegal to do?

Like I know porn sites have age warnings but let’s face it - they aren’t verifying people’s ages - it’s a trust system. Could she get in trouble for this legally? 

I’m so shocked I’ve been sick to my stomachs since I discovered what she is doing.

Please I could use some advice."

I really like my course and everything but I feel like no one likes me. I don't know what part of it is my anxiety and what's the truth. At first I thought I was getting along with everyone and I hung out with them like two times or so and I was so happy that I met nice people in New city and new college. But recently I've noticed the same people hanging out and making plans without me, they even have a separate group chat and I'm not in it. I'm keep seeing them post on Facebook and other social media pictures from parties and nights out.. And then at college they make new plans and even though I'm with them they don't invite me they just ignore my presence, some of them are actually hostile towards me.. and say things like ""yeah let's meet there and there I'll let you know later in group chat "". They all just like me were mostly new in the city and didn't know each other before. I have lots of friends outside of college but I have to spend most of the time in an environment where I feel disliked and excluded and I really don't know what did I do to them. I'm actually considering dropping out because it feels so shitty to be there lol

EDIT: I really didn't expect so many replies! Thank you for all advices and I'm sorry so many of you can relate.
I've decided to stop obsessing over it and just focus on my studies. I don't care if I'm going to be the weirdo with no friends of college. I don't need to force friendships. "

Lol this seems like such an odd question. When I google it, I just get a whole bunch of dermatologist linked blogs instead of a straight answer. I only wash my hair 2-3x a week, and scrub my body with dove soap for sensitive skin.  I have a pretty good AM/PM skincare routine, and usually moisturize before bed.

I used to never shower 2x a day. However, now that I have back issues, I wake up with a really stiff back. Taking a warm shower and doing some light stretching really helps get rid of stiffness. After my work day, I usually do some sort of exercise. Gym, yoga, biking, walk/jog, whatever. Usually I have a good sweat worked up and don’t feel comfortable changing into clean clothes and laying down when I feel gross. 

My coworkers were talking about how bad it is to actually shower every day. Since my skin is a little more tight and not soft and supple, I’m starting to wonder if more showers were bad, even though they felt good for my muscles. This is deff an odd and super paranoid question for me to have, but thanks for reading!

Update: thank you all so much for the advice. I wish I could reply to each of you! Especially thoughts inquiring about my back 😂 my back is due to a physical issue I have with my hips due to a bad horseback riding fall, and is something I’m constantly in PT for but will deal with lifelong.

I've been working in a small medical practice for about seven months. The doctor has treated me off and on since I started the position. When he treats me, he does things that that would be inappropriate in a normal setting, but because he's a doctor it almost feels warranted. It's a uncomfortable feeling to put it simply. I've always felt uncomfortable around him. He makes inappropriate comments like talking to me in graphic detail how much he likes sex and oral. Were closed on fridays and he always tries to get me to come into the office and be alone with him, but I make excuses and have never gone in.

Yesterday he calls me into his office to look over some notes for a patient. While talking he grabs the draw string on my scrub pants and pulls it to untie the string on my scrubs. So I jump back like ""what are you doing"" and start to tie my scrub pants back up, he reaches forward and grabs my crotch. I'm so caught off guard I jumped back and almost fell. He says ""is this a camel toe?"" And I jump back and say no and walk away to the kitchen where he follows me repeating the question. I tried to do anything I could to change the subject and get away until I could finally get back into my office.

Today I called out sick. I just couldn't even face him. I called a couple hotlines today and I have gotten answers varying from search legal action to do nothing and stand up for myself. The one counselor told me, if I report to the police, they will do a controlled call. Have me call him while listening in and see if he admits. Is this true? My biggest concern is; if I pursue legal action, being that he only assaulted me,  there is no proof, and no one else saw,  that it's his word against mine and he'll win. I mean He's a Dr.  Is it worth pressing charges or do I go back to work, stay away from him, continue to look for another job, and if he tries anything else stand up and say something to him? Is there anything that protects me coming out against him in this situation?

Edit: The doctor is my Boss. He owns the practice."

Hey Reddit,
I just moved into a new appartment (4 people 4 rooms a small kitchen and a smalll bathroom) and currently I m alone with one girl since the other roommates are in vacation atm.
When i moved in i realized that the girl had a crush on me but i didnt do anything with it since i have a girlfriend i m absolutely happy with.
my Girlfriend came for a visit for 2 weeks 3 days ago and since then my roommate is behaving super shitty.
Nothing to bad about it i just told myself she might be jelly or pissed.

Now yesterday i found my tomatomash Jar (freshly bought 1 day before) that is stored in the shared fridge to smell like nail polish remover. Still i didnt think much about it kicked it in the bin and ate aivar instead.
now Today i opened the fridge and the aivar smells the exact same way. Its a super distinct smell everyone recognizes it the same. 
Asking for advice on what to do

UPDATE:
After someone said that i should hold a lighter into the poisoned food. I tried that and it didnt burn so i figured it was defenitely no nail polish remover.
Going further i found out which of the components of nail polish remover makes it smell that bad and then found out that brandy vinegar causes the same smell when fermenting
I checked the contents of both jars and found this to be contained in both.
Now it takes a really massive coincidence to actually have both fermenting the same time since they were both pretty fresh but that seems to be the solution.
I will face my roommate with the smell but for now i m pretty sure I just had a bad trip of thoughts and maybe she has after all nothing to do with it. I keep you updated when i have her reaction to me showing her the smell of it.


UPDATE2:
i figuered its sure the vinnegar thing and feel safe now.
she still behaved like a bitch when my gf is around and like the nicest person when we are alone 
also she comes to the kitchen in underwear when she hears that i m a alone... not only once but regularly 


Thanks to you reddit I could solve the problem no one is or will be harmed!

Yesterday as I was driving along, an old banger of a car pulled out the junction straight into me, he had a lifetime to stop, giving me enough time to swerve so he just took out my back end, not doing too much damage, just denting the wheel arch and the car in a few places, his car was worse off than mine. 

I'm usually pretty calm in these situations but I did give a long blast on the horn because it was really dumb driving on the other guy's part. I got out the car ready to ask him what the hell he was doing, but immediately stopped when the first thing the guy says is ""I'm reawy sowwy."" He quite clearly had some kind of mental handicap, really changing my reaction to ""It's alright mate don't worry these things happen."" I'm more concerned about him now really. 

My Dad works in the car trade and could get my car fixed for about £200, although he says the damage isnt bad enough that it needs to be fixed and I could just take the money without bothering to get the work done. I told the guy he'd be better off giving me the cash rather than claiming on his insurance. He's coming round tonight to give it to me. But I really don't know whether or not to take it. I've been worried about the guy ever since, can he afford it? Has it kept him awake all night too worrying about it? The guy was lovely, he was driving to his job as a carer, he kept apologising and didn't try anything. 

Everyone is telling me to take the money, they say I'll be stupid not to, he did damage my car and it was his fault. But what if he can't afford it? Not even that but I don't like to take that much money off anyone, I know I'd hate to have to give it to someone for a silly mistake. Basically I don't want to take it because the guy is a really nice disabled man and I wouldn't even use the money to fix the car, and I can't bring myself to take the money.

What would you do?

(Also, is there a better sub to post this in?)

Update - Thank you all very much for your replies, I didn't expect this many. I don't have time to write a detailed update but he called me and said he'll come round tonight. He did and showed up with his daughter in the back seat, which I was surprised about, didn't imagine him having kids. But he brought the £200 and asked me to sign a piece of paper saying I'd accepted it, which I did. 

I said this is strange for me as I've never been in an accident, and asked if he had, he said he'd been driving 10 years and been in one that wasn't hit fault, so if he's telling the truth crashing isn't a regular occurrence for him, like a lot of people were concerned about. I explained I wasn't happy taking money off of anyone, and offered him half the money back, as I wasn't too worried about my car, it seems okay. 

He asked if was sure and said it was very nice to give it back, but accepted it. I wished him well and said goodbye. I'm happy I gave it back. The money wasn't a big deal for me and I got the opinion it wasn't for him either, so I was happy to compromise half way. And yes, I would've worried about this just as much whatever race, shape age of the person that crashed into me, I just didn't have to worry about this person's circumstances because he was clearly already at a disadvantage with his disability.

Thanks for all of your replies, I read them all despite not replying to them all. I understand most of you said I should take the whole amount, but this seems a fair compromise for me, I think we all learned enough of a lesson here. Thanks again, peace out"

But from some weeks there has been a change in his behavior . He seems to be attracted by me physically. Yes, it may sound weird but it is the truth. 

He would be walking past me and would touch my crotch 'accidently' . I didn't notice all this until yesterday. He has been down with fever from some days so I sleep in his room with him.

Now, I am writing this . He is my first child and don't know if this is normal or not. I would want to talk to him about this but don't want him to feel awkward or bad. What should I do? Should I talk to him about this?

Lyft won't refund me. Hey, everyone. This is a bit of doozy.

I (22f) had a Lyft driver who picked me up from my house one Friday. She had signs on the backs of her car headrests that said things like ""no changing clothes,"" ""no make up,"" &amp; ""no outside liquids but water."" which is totally fine, but also 

""no hacking phones. if i see anyone hacking mine or anyones phone during the drive, i will report you to not only lyft but to homeland security &amp; other government agencies."" 

I think to myself weird, but whatever. I just want to get to my destination. 

The driver is an older black woman &amp; she makes conversation with me. I can tell this woman is a very paranoid person from how she talks about her previous experiences with Lyft. She felt like the passenger she was going to pick up before me was trying to kill her. We have some reservoirs for rain water near my house &amp; she commented that the city needed to take better care of them in case people were dumping bodies in there. That has never really happened in our city as far as I know of. Her talk of death makes me uncomfortable but I try to stay quiet &amp; not really engage her. 

Here is where things start to fall apart. Her phone starts to act slow, the gps is giving her weird directions. She straight up asks ""are you hacking my phone?"" I'm a very anxious person &amp; I don't handle confrontation well so I ignore it. Her phone is still giving her issues, &amp; she keeps on looking back at me. 

Finally she points at her sign (""no hacking"") &amp; asks me if I've read it. I'm already on edge so I ask her if she's accusing me of something. 

""Well, my phone only started acting slow when you got in."" 

Ok?? I tell her I literally don't know her &amp; why would I want anything to do with her information?? 

She almost gets into an accident while accusing me because she keeps on turning around to face me instead of the road. At this point, I ask to get out. I'm really scared &amp; uncomfortable &amp; I don't want to be around her anymore. She pulls over cursing at me to get out but won't unlock the door to let me out. I hit the door &amp; yelled at her until she finally unlocks it. I call her crazy &amp; slam it. She rolls down her window to call me a bitch. 

I call my brother to pick me up. It takes him a while to get there &amp; she is still pulled over the whole time I'm waiting, making a report on ME to Lyft. My brother comes, we take some pictures of her car &amp; the signs. This upsets her &amp; she tries to take pictures of my brothers car, but we speed off. 

I contacted Lyft to report her. I found out she had reported me to Lyft for using a derogatory term towards her during our ride &amp; for that reason, they won't issue me a refund. I'm a college student, I would really like my money back after one their drivers endangered my life, threatened to report me homeland security, insulted me, &amp; wouldn't let me out of her car until she was done. 

I'm waiting for a representative to contact me about this but until then, are there any tips that can help me get my money back?

Thanks in advance to any insight."

Okay, here is the long story. 

I am 16, living in California. ~8Months ago I was added on snapchat by a user named Amy. I added, and didn't hear anything or receive any messages from ""Amy"" for 8 months. Last night she messaged me, making small talk and then asking me to send nude photos to her, in exchange for her to send back. This isn't that uncommon for people my age, but I was confused as I didn't even know who she was. I asked her ""who even are you, have we met?"" and she claimed that we had met a few months ago, at a school dance, and that she went to a random high school that is about 45 minutes away from where I live/My school. 



I was skeptical at this point, but still not sure this was a fake situation. I asked her what her instagram was, which is something that 99.9% of social teens my age have. She had ""just deleted her account."" Ok, this is getting suspicious. She then said, ""Just watch"" and proceeded to send me images of a girl my age nude, and then an extremely sexual video (not trying to be too graphic). I noticed between the video and the photo, they had different aspect ratios. For those who don't know about digital imagery, this means that the video and photo were taken on different cameras. You can tell this because on the photos, they filled my entire screen, but on the video, there were black bars on the bottom and top of my screen to make the video fit properly without stretching it. At this point I knew this was some sort of scam or catfish, etc. I called her out on using a program to upload photos to snapchat and send, which is against the TOS of Snapchat, and shows that she is lying. 


She denied it ""I don't know what you're talking about, wtf."" I pressed harder and she still denied it. I stopped responding for a few hours. I figured it was just some sexually excited teenage girl who wanted nudes but didn't want to send her own photo, and just let it go to that, but my curiosity was killing me. I messaged her again, ""I know its fake,  but my curiosity is killing me, how do you upload to Snapchat, why do you do it... I need answers!"" She claimed I was the ""first one to notice it was fake"" and such, explaining that she is ""self conscious about her body"" so uses other womens photos to seem more attractive. Seems legit, I still was suspicious, but that made sense. I was trying very hard to figure out who she was or her instagram, and she even gave me a fake name, but claimed she blocked me on instagram because she didn't want me to accidentally find her account. Before she left, she did something very strange, she said: ""Just rate me, on 1-10, how hot am I"" and sent a photo of a girls face, fully clothed etc. Linked [here](http://imgur.com/a/nwQMF). I said ""wtf"" and she blocked me. Although, before she blocked me I screenshotted that photo. I did a google reverse image lookup and found nothing, so I put it through a deeper reverse image lookup and found it on two websites. ""amateurmastrabations.com"" and ""poringa.com."" See screenshots of search results [here](http://prntscr.com/fqisvv).


 I sent the screenshot of the girl around to some of my other guy friends, asking if they had ever received it. One of my really old friends recognized it, and asked if some girl named Amy tried to catfish me using it. I quickly called him and got all the info he had on her. He said she added him OVER A YEAR AGO through the username ######.marie56, (I am blocking out the first part because I don't want anyone to add her and let her know that I am investigating the situation). This was strange because she added me on ######.marie57. Two different accounts, same screen name, same username formula, only thing different was the number. I figured that whoever is behind this must be using the same formula for all of the accounts, so I did a search. I found that the same username was used, with the exact same screen name, only thing different was the numbers, 7 different times (see screenshot here)[http://imgur.com/a/nwQMF]. This on it's own wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the account she added me on alone had over 2 thousand snapchat score. For those not familiar with snapchat, this means that she has sent/received over 2,000 messages/photos on that account alone. That's a lot of teenage boys. 



Back to my friend. He said that she added him OVER a year ago, and tried to catfish him about seven months ago, claiming that she had met him at a school dance, just like me, but at a different school. This makes me think that whoever is behind this has a system of gaining the trust of the kids. Additionally, my friend was sent a phone number from her. After doing a reverse phone lookup for that phone, I found it was registered as VOIP at XO Communications. Looking into XO Communications, it seems like it is an enterprise voip provider, meaning that whoever is behind this would have had to purchase MANY phone lines. (I could be wrong on that, correct me if so). That's where I'm at right now. The fact that its registered with XO communications makes me think that it's some sort of larger scheme, as well as the fact that one of the photos I was sent was on what I believe to be a child pornography site. (amateurmastrabations.com - I didn't visit the site, so I don't know for sure) This means that whoever is behind this, also visits the child porn sites, or had visited as some point. 

There are a few possibilities on whats going on here, and I'll let you decided what you guys think is most likely. 

1) This is some sort of scheme to catfish young boys into sending nude photos, and then selling them on child porn sites, etc. The reason I believe this to be true is because of the amount of accounts that exist under this alias, the fact that one of these photos was from a child porn site, AND the fact that the number was registered from a B2B Voip Service. 

2) This is someone my age, trying to get pictures of other people my age, but not wanting to use their own photos. The problem with this theory is that all the evidence is stacked against it. Why would they get a clothed picture of a girl our age from amateurmastrabations.com when they could easily steal one from google images or from a peer's instagram account? What person my age (mid teens) would set up this long of a con, one in which they catfish for over a year now, set up fake voip numbers, numerous snapchat accounts, etc. 

3) Something else.


Thats it, that's the situation. I hate to beg for upvotes, but it would be nice to have this seen and read by as many people as possible. The reason I'm posting it here is because I don't know what to do/what I can do. If there is a better sub to post this, please let me know. If you think you could help me, shoot me a PM and we can figure out a way to communicate there. Thanks for reading, I know that was a novella.

My health insurance through Kaiser was cancelled July 1 because of non-payment of premium.  I never received the notice in the mail (I blame the USPS for this, as I frequently find my mail randomly in the parking lot of my building. The mail carrier puts it in the wrong slot and then the mail-slot owner places my mail on top of the box and then it ends up on the ground).  I also never received the email from Kaiser explaining that I was about to lose my coverage since it came from a different email than the regular Kaiser emails, so it ended up in my spam mail folder.

I know I am also at fault because I should have played a more pro-active role in making sure my bills were up to date and paid for.  I always set my bills to auto-pay so I will never forget.  I know I attempted to set Kaiser up as auto-pay but I guess it never went through somehow.  So yes I am a dumbass that let his health insurance lapse.

Now Kaiser won't let me reinstate my coverage because of non-payment of premium.  They say I am ineligible for a special enrollment period and will have to wait until November for open enrollment.  Waiting that long is not an option, as I have ongoing health issues and prescriptions.

I have also called my state's health insurance marketplace but they cannot help me either.  All because of non-payment of premium.  I have the money, I am willing to pay, I am just a space cadet sometimes.

Isn't Obamacare supposed to make sure people get covered no matter the circumstances?  I am sitting here waving money in Kaiser's face but they won't take it.  Reddit, what can I do?

EDIT--- 

SUCCESS!!!!!!  Thank you everyone for your help and suggestions!!

I was finally able to get a new KP health plan starting Sept 1 through MD Health Connection. They said I would have to call back later to change effective date to Aug 1, idk why but whatever at least I am signed up now.  It was the 5th call to them (I also called Kaiser about 5 times) and either I happened to get somebody who cared enough to help me this time, or I managed to explain the situation with the right words that convinced them.  In any case, the lady was able to help me because she said it wasn't entirely my fault.

It took way too much effort and 90% of the people I talked to said there was literally nothing they could do, which of course is a lie."

Fearing the worst what are some great ways to meet new people when you’re 20 and not in school. Everyone at work is 28+ so there’s a tad disconnect not to mention I’m in a supervisory position and that’s usually a bad to do.

I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post this too but I’d like advice on it. Sorry if the formatting is awful, I’m on mobile. Also the ages I’m giving were our ages at the time, not current.

Backstory: I (15 F) had a best friend who I had known since middle school for about 8 years. Our age gap was kind of big but I skipped a grade and she was in the grade above me and had an early birthday. We did everything together, were referred to as “the girls” by all of our teachers, basically inseparable (I know this doesn’t seem relevant but it’s important to know). 

 So she (18 F) was put into a study hall with a new teacher (35ish M), and was the only student in the class for most of the semester so they got pretty close. She regularly talked to me about how she felt like he was hitting on her, and I believed her even though she has a long history of thinking simple things were guys “coming onto her”.

 The next semester, even though she said he made her uncomfortable, she decided to be a teachers aid for him during his prep hour. So she would be alone with him in his classroom for a whole period every day. I was an office aid for this class period so I would go visit her and hang out in his classroom a lot. The three of us ended up getting really close and talked about a lot of stuff (ie. crushes, family problems, school issues, stuff like that). He told us about his kid and his ex wife and his family and everything about his life.

 This is the point where I’ll point out that prior to me getting to know him, he asked her a lot of questions about me and even asked where I lived (SHE SHOWED HIM ON GOOGLE MAPS). He said he knew my parents and knew a lot about their messy divorce but when I asked them about him they had no idea who he was, not really that crazy because we lived in a very small town but still odd.

Over the course of the semester where we were both aids, he started asking more personal questions. Like what we liked about certain guys and what we found attractive in men. It got to the point where he went through the faculty list and asked us which male teachers we found attractive (we skipped over his picture), and what we thought about certain sexual things. I’ll admit we answered too many questions but both of us have the infamous “Daddy issues” and were grossly attracted to older men, not an excuse but it’s something to consider.

 Summer came and went and we didn’t talk to him obviously, but when we came back to school (my senior year and her second senior year) we went right back into our close relationship with him. We ate lunch in his classroom every day (sometimes other students would be in there but rarely).

My friend had an issue with waking up for school and I’m an absolute stickler about getting places 10-20 minutes before I would need to be. We weren’t in any particular friend group and mostly floated around so when I got to school really early I would just go to his classroom and hang out. She joined me when she actually came to school before lunch, but that was very rarely. 

Since we spent so much one on one time together and I was admittedly more mature than my friend, the teacher and I got closer than he was with her. Partially because when he started paying more attention to me (cringing as I write that) she would get somewhat upset and kind of be rude to both of us. At one point during this time he asked if we were virgins and when we both answered yes, the next morning when we were alone he asked me if I was actually serious about being a virgin and that he believed her but not me.

 I had a lot of home issues at this point and we talked about them a lot. I trusted him with just about everything and he told me a lot about his life as well. He made it a point to ask about my home life and to make it known that he cared for me a lot. As well as talking to me about social issues and when I had problems with my friend he was always egging me on and completely on my side (this wasn’t super weird because she did a lot of messed up stuff and treated me poorly regularly, everyone that I told about it was on my side).

He was very flirty and I’ve got a bubbly, flirty personality (again not an excuse) so it was obvious to some other students that we were oddly close and I’m sure someone had to notice. But halfway through the year we started going out to lunch a lot more or eating with friends in the lunchroom, and basically completely dropped off communication.

 However the summer after our graduation, we were both friends with him on Facebook, and he reached out to me (17 at this point, age of consent is 18 where I’m from). At first it was normal, close teacher reaching out before college and checking in type of thing. But it turned to him admitting he “couldn’t help but notice” my body (I developed very young, about 11, and have what would be considered a curvy body). And that he had thought about me sexually, I admitted to having a crush on him at one point but told him I was just a young girl in high school who was looking for male attention. (EDIT: I forgot to mention an important point, shortly after saying he was sexually attracted to me he asked if I wanted to meet up and do stuff when I returned to our town at the end of summer. I stay with family out of state for the whole summer every year.)

I got really weirded out at this point and stopped answering but at like 4am he messaged me that he “couldn’t stop thinking about me” and I ended up blocking him.

Now I’m well aware that the relationship wasn’t appropriate but, my main question is if I was being groomed or not? I read an article about grooming that resonated with me and I’d like to know other people’s opinion on it. As well as if I should reach out to anyone in the school about the situation, because I don’t want another girl who’s going through a rough patch to actually do anything she would regret with him. Keep in mind I was 15 when our relationship started becoming suggestive, which is not an age that I feel is appropriate for a 35 year old (with a child that was closer to my age than I was to him) to be interested in.

(EDIT: I didn’t mention when I originally posted this but, when he admitted to being sexually attracted to me he said that he would have brought it up to me while I was still a student. He said he didn’t because I never pushed for it to be sexual past being kind of flirty and answering the questions he asked me.)

I know the post is long but I’m just really lost on what to do/if I should do anything."

I'ts 5 am, I am a night bird, was still up surfing the net, about ready to call it a night. It's dark out, and cold. The doorbell rings, WTF. Rings again. Then knocking.

Ah man. Quickly get dressed still putting on my boots I turned on the front light and looked thru the blinds in the door. Crying teenage girl says thru the door ""Can you help me please"". Decision time, I live in a high crime city in Canada. No question, I have to open the door, she has to wait a bit while I put on my boots, if there's going to be a fight, I want my boots on. Open the door just a drunk, crying girl wearing only a jeans and a hoodie in -20C windchill. ""Can you please charge my phone, I have to call my boyfriend"". Invite her inside.

I'm a klutz with phones, I don't have a smartphone no charger handy, my wife has one but she's asleep. Tell her ""No I can't charge your phone, let's phone him from my land line"". She tells me ""I don't know his number, it's in my phone my phone is dead, can you charge it"".

So it begins 10 minutes of round and round with a drunk teenage girl getting increasingly frustrated with me. I attempt to phone information to find boyfriend's number, she has no patience for this, accuses me of phoning police. Then says she'll walk to his place I don't know exactly where he lives but I think it's 30+ minute walk, drunk wearing a hoodie, jeans, runners no socks. I offer to pay for a cab. No. I say I will drive her home, where does she live - 20-30 minute drive across town. Let me drive you home you can charge your phone at home talk to your boyfriend later today. ""NO, can you drive me to my boyfriend's place?"". I don't want any part of that.

What am I getting into here? How old are you I ask her? ""I'm 19"". OK, I guess she probably is, I'm old, everybody looks really young, but OK 19. Ask her why did you knock on my door? Answer ""You're house #2, neighbour didn't answer"". Apparently she angrily exited a friend's car (maybe the BF?) and was walking around, and had enough of being cold.

I try phoning information again, she accuses me of phoning the cops (note: in retrospect not a bad idea). Can't talk sense into her, I'm an old dope I guess, she calls herself stupid many times, then calls me stupid. Things go down hill, she's barefoot puts her runners back on and declares she's going to walk to her boyfriend's. I'm at wits end, I'm worried about the girl, panic, run upstairs turn on light in bedroom, wife is out cold. Say loudly to sleeping person in bed: ""Wake up, I have a drunk 19 yr old girl downstairs wants me to drive her to her boyfriend's"". Real smooth by husband. Wife jumps up in bed, looks around like house is on fire. After about 10 seconds she wakes up and says ""Call the police"".

Girl is trying to open front door to leave it's locked (I locked it behind us in case she has a pal hiding in the dark). Says to me ""Open the door, this is like a kidnapping situation"". I've about had enough, OK open the door and tell her I am phoning the police. She vanishes into the night. I feel like shit.

Immediately phone 911, tell dispatcher the details, drunk 19 yr old only wearing hoodie, describe her as best I can, worried she'll freeze to death. They surprise me by saying they're dispatching a car while we speak. Talk a bit more, I'm high on adrenaline I guess. Ask the dispatcher ""What the hell should I have done?"" Tells me ""I don't recommend you drive her and get in the middle of whatever she had going on"".

I left her alone in the kitchen when I scurried into the den and the computer to try to google her boyfriend's info. To her credit she didn't take anything ... my wallet and my wife's purse were right there. Should have been more careful about that, didn't dawn on me till my wife got up to check her purse after the girl walked away. A crazy 15 minutes.

So I feel like crap, maybe should have pushed a lot harder on offer to phone cab. This escapade was not my finest moment.  Advice?

Hey reddit, trying to keep things short on this post but there'll be a TL;DR.



So, I'm a 22M from the southeast US, recently had to get out of my parents house for an argument (haven't we all?) (long story of psychological abuse from my mother, I've been suicidal for a long time because of it, but basically I can't be there anymore), I don't have a job, I've been trying to get one for months but my applications haven't been getting me anywhere.
Thankfully my friend hooked me up, and I have an interview this Monday. (Still no guarantee, and technically still no place to live.)




But back to business, I'm left with no choice but to live out my car for a few days, possibly weeks in case none of my friends have their doors open. I was wondering what advice some of you might have for someone like me in this situation. I'm considering getting a tent, and hopping from camp spot to camp spot, but I'm running out of cash due to my car payment/insurance bills. Let's just say I have about 3 months before I'm run dry.




So, any good explanation for food that lasts a while and doesn't require cooking or refrigeration?



Thanks guys.

Also, he owes me $500. What should I do? It's really stressing me out. Hi,

     I lent my brother some money for groceries and stuff. $250 worth. We haven't been paying the electric bill, (or so I thought) because we were going to let it stack up a couple months and then talk with the community action center who already told us the electric company will wave a one time charge of up to $500 or so.

However, seeing as how I'm an idiot sometimes, I didn't realize that I was actually paying the electric bill (it was on auto-pay and I just didn't notice). So, now I feel like I've been paying the electric bill for several months by myself and that it's not fair. So I added his half of the electric bill to the $250 that he owes me and told him that he can wait three months to pay me back and that we wouldn't pay the electric bill for those three months and do the community action center, electric waiver for those three months. Seems like that's fair right?

So, that's how I came up with the $500.

Now, he's borderline depressed at this point. Makes suicidal remarks when I hassle him about his responsibilities and it worries me. I'm sure they're jokes, but still.

He's not on the apartment lease. Only I am.
He works in Idaho and I work in Washington. We live on the border. I have two jobs in Washington. One where I make min. + tips, and one where I make $15/hour. 

He makes $7.50 plus tips as a barista in Idaho, but it's not cutting it. I try and convince him to get a job in WA. but he just hasn't put in the effort. 

I've even gone so far as to let him use MY resume and tweak it, but still, it doesn't get done.

Furthermore, the house is a disaster, he uses all my stuff (soap and things like that). I'm honestly pretty generous, but it sucks to work as much as I do and get taken advantage of.

He smokes weed everyday. Is failing college. 
It's ridiculous.
Like, I get being lazy when your priorities are taken care of, but when they're not, you've gotta get up and make things happen.

I'm not a pushover. But my assertiveness and serious nature are lost on him probably because he's family and knows what he can get away with. 

I don't want to have to play the tough love card and kick him out, but I also don't know how to motivate him to get his shit together.

His dad's rich, but won't help him because he's acting like a loser.
With that said, his dad told him to make a budget and the implication was that he'd help him financially and he was supposed to have had that done by Thanksgiving and here we are...

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: He confirmed after a confrontation that he is indeed suicidal and depressed. Not sure what to do. He wants me stop hassling him about delivering resumes and making a budget. "

Things boiled over last night. I had a child with my girlfriend in high school, my daughter, A. I ended up developing feelings for the girl (C) I hired to baby sit her when i needed help during college (after her mother and I separated), and we got married. 

At the time we got married (when A was 7) things seemed fine. C was kind and attentive and worried about her care. However, things started to change when C had twins two years later. Suddenly everything A did was wrong, from little things like making too much noise getting ready for school, to big things like the time she (at nine, mind) got a bunch of rainbow highlighters and colored our extremely patient dalmation, and she needed to be ""punished"" for all of them. I intervened numerous times, until I couldn't tell myself that my wife was just having a bad day anymore, at which point I pushed my wife to go to therapy. She did, and I didn't hear anything more about how much she didn't like my daughter, or how ""bad"" my daughter was, until last night.

I should note here: My daughter moved in with us full time when she was 12, when she was removed from her mother's house by CPS. That was when I learned her stepfather had been physically and sexually abusive. I immediately got my daughter medical help and therapy, and while she's not the ""super preppy happy all the time"" teenager, I feel like she's definitely doing well and has a handle on the mental fallout of that.

Last week was my daughter's 17th birthday, and we'd decided to let her have a bunch of (female) friends over. My wife and I and the twins retreated upstairs, and let them take over the living room and kitchen.

We have two very large bookshelves in our living room, filled top to bottom with books, and have always had a policy that anyone can come grab any book to read, any time. At some point around 11 pm, (I had been dead asleep), my daughter stormed upstairs, pushed open my bedroom door, and threw a book at my wife and I, before cursing us out. Then she and her friends got into a car and left. My wife turned white upon seeing the book, and tried to ""go put it away"" but i grabbed it to see what it was. 

It was one of those ""self-help"" books where you are supposed to ""meditate"" on a topic each day. Every page was filled with my wife's handwriting, talking about how much she hated A. Her grievances apparently ranged from the fact that I spend too much time and money on my daughter, to her believing that my daughter 'seduced' her stepfather.

My wife swears that book was part of her therapy, and she must have ""accidentally"" put it on the shelves downstairs and not kept it in our room, but when I went downstairs I found a number of other books just like it. Nearly every ""self-help"" book was filled with how much she despises A.

I called A numerous times to see how she was doing and make sure she was safe, as well as checking the location of her phone on my computer. She went to stay at one of her friend's houses last night, and I spoke to her friend's parents who said they would let her stay with them last night and tonight and take her to school on Monday. So I know she's safe, and while I was writing this she sent me a text so I'm hoping to talk with her.

My bigger issue is, what do I do about C? On the one hand, I know having a child forced onto you is hard, especially when she went through something as traumatic as A did. On the other hand, she knew I had a child long before we started dating, much less getting married. She knew my daughter was a priority for me, and my daughter is still a *child*, no matter how much she likes to pretend she's the smartest adult in the room. I'd have believed one book was an accident, but over a dozen? I thought she was getting therapy for this. 

My wife has been sulking all morning, since she knows I'm angry, and the twins keep asking for their sister. I am just at a loss as to what to do. Any advice you have would help."

I used to use Kik, so I know what the notification sounds like and I also know what kind of activity typically goes on there nowadays. Me and my mom were home alone in the kitchen when I heard the all too familiar sound of the Kik notification from her phone. She looked down at her phone for a few seconds before turning her phone off again. I don’t remember if it was that time or a time after but I was able to catch a glimpse of the notification and the name of the person who texted her was “*city near us* Beefcake”. It’s because of that and the fact that my parents communicate through iMessage that I know it isn’t my father. I immediately got a horrible feeling about it. All throughout the Christmas season I’d hear that annoying notification sound from her phone or would catch her on Kik, but would never be able to read any of the messages. After Christmas, I didn’t see/hear anything for a while and my parents seemed more affectionate so I convinced myself I’d just been paranoid and nothing was wrong. But today I went out with my mom and the entire time I would hear that stupid notification. She was glued to her phone, texting whoever this may be. I wanted to say “why are you on kik?” Just so she’d know that I know that she’s on Kik. But I got too nervous and never did. When I’d try to subtly move closer to her just to see if I could sneak a peak at her phone, she’d subtly shift away. I’m a crazy paranoid person, so I have no idea if this is all in my head and I’m just exaggerating the situation. I don’t know what to do. Next time I hear her on Kik, should I say anything? My mom’s still affectionate towards my dad, but they’re really good about hiding their issues from me and keeping that stuff behind closed doors. I feel like this is eating me from the inside out and I don’t want to ask any of my friends about it. I just really need to know if my fears are valid and what I should do, if anything at all."

I went bar hopping this weekend with my best friend. By the end of the night I was definitely drunk, but not nearly as drunk as I’ve been before in the past. I had one cocktail, a beer, and 2 shots. I have a pretty high tolerance and can handle my liquor well. At the last bar, I started dancing with a guy and noticed I was feeling VERY off. My body felt heavy and I kept blacking out. The next thing I remember was being in his apartment and taking a shower and then being brought to the bedroom. I was unconscious until I felt some intense pain/pressure as he was anally raping me. I screamed out in pain and was told to be quiet and then I blacked out again. When I regained consciousness, there were two other men in the room I had not seen before. One of the men was putting his pants back on and the other was on top of me and undressing. I was then made to perform oral sex and was raped again. I blacked out for the last time and was then driven back to my car in the morning. I was still very out of it by then and not really remembering everything.  I took a nap once I got home, and when I woke up my memory came back to me. I called the police and had a friend take me to the hospital. My statement was taken and they did a rape kit. 

I am absolutely beside myself. I don’t even know how to begin to heal from this and move on. I don’t know what my next steps should be. I don’t know how to get rest. I don’t know how to look people in the eye. How do I live with this and get back to a mentally healthy place?

There is an 8 month old male German Shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. I have a six month old Australian Shepherd. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

I first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. They said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.

After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.

I do not know the logistic of ESD's but I do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. What should I do in this situation? I feel that if I go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume ESD's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true)."

To add insult to injury he's been blatantly going around and spreading rumors and lies about me.   Telling others im not a right fit for the company, etc...etc.    he's also...self-admittedly racist towards me and 2x co-workers. (His words,  not mine).



He has no degrees, and this gig will most likely be his final job before retirement (he's in his 40's). 

Do I not say anything and hope this will change his opinion on me? Or do I rat him out and see him fired (as our admin won't bat an eye to firing him....as this broken rule could've easily broken our contract)???


Thank you all in advanced 



___________________________


EDIT /  update :  I just want to thank everyone. I seriously considered what EVERYONE has said to do.  So earlier this morning, I asked the employee to grab a cup of coffee and maybe just have a talk.  He declined, but then called me back an hour or two later and accepted. 
I sat down with him and came forward about what he had done.  He was taken back and nervous.   
I explained that I wasn't going to say anything, but that i'd hope his attitude would change in the workplace.  I deleted the video in front of him and let him know that i do not have any copies ( i don't).  

This was probably the most eye opening moment in our work relationship.  He cried and thanked me. He explained that he was envious that I was chosen over him for the lead / super position in our workspace and explained he could've used the money, benefits, etc. 


I explained that i was just more qualified etc...etc.. and that if there was ever a chance I could help him, that he'd just let me know. 


As of 3 hours into the work day.... there's been a complete shift in his attitude and work communication. He isn't this huge dick that we all associate him to be.  instead he's being quite nice.  

I sincerely.....from the heart want to thank you all for your input.  I won't lie...i initially wanted him out.  But I remember reading here that whenever someone takes a low blow.... go the higher route... kind of like the saying ""kill them with kindness"". 

Hopefully this small gesture will not only change his perspective and dissipate any racial stereotypes he has about my ethnicity, and lead to an overall better ""Him"". 


Let's just hope that the new him stays this way, as he's actually quite nice to have around. 


THANKS AGAIN YALL"

I just turned 22 and tonight I was sitting on the couch with my step dad (my mum and younger half brother were out) and my step dad comes over and asks if we’re still friends and I told him that we were.

He then leans in and gives me lots of hugs and kisses on the check and then leaves to go out. What is important to know is that:
1. This is one of the least affection people I know. Like we don’t talk a whole lot nor do we ever hug let alone anything else.
2. He did this last year when my mum and brother were overseas and I honestly felt like he was hitting on me. I felt very uncomfortable but ultimately didn’t tell anyone about it and until tonight, nothing similar has ever happened so I’ve always thought that I was reading way to much into it.

So yeah, he went off and I was at the house by myself and everything was okay. Then he comes back home and we were chatting and he sits down next to me and I could smell cigarette smoke on him so I told him to go brush his teeth otherwise my mum would know that he’s been smoking. Anyway he goes off and does that and then comes and stands behind me and gives me a hug. 

As he’s doing this, he starts putting his hands on my boobs and starts to rub them. He then starts to go to my bra and he asked if he could and all I did was shake my head. He kept asking me and all I could do was shake my head no. He then eventually stops and tells me not to tell my mum (which he did last time) and then tells me that he would love to spend the night with me and asks if he can. All I can do is shake my head no and he clarifies that he would only want to cuddle. 

He then said “okay well you’re mum will be home soon like so we better stop. Are we friends?” 

All I can do is nod my head yes. I sat still on that couch until my mum got home and I went straight to my room. I feel disgusting and dirty and I don’t want to be here. I want to go to my partners house but I know that if I leave here now my mother will ask where I’m going and will see me in my current state.

I want to tell my mum what happened. She doesn’t deserve to be with a man like that, my brother (who is 7) shouldn’t have that as a role model and I can’t be around him, but I can’t risk loosing my mother. She is my best friend and if she doesn’t believe me I’d be lost without her but I have to say something to her. But how? How do I tell her? What do I say? When do I say it? I can’t tell her on the weekend, I can’t do it while my brother is around, he needs to be at school. So how do I live between now and then? I’m making myself sick with this and I just really need some help. Please.

EDIT: I would like to thank everyone who has taken the time to write me, send their advice, concerns and support. You have no idea how much I needed to read your words.

I must admit I already knew what I had to do, but I needed that reassurance that it was the right thing to do. As it is 1am here (Australia) nothing will be happening tonight. I already have a bag packed and will be heading to my partner’s first thing in the morning and I’ll be telling my mum why I’m going too.

Once again, thank you all so much for your message of support. It means a great deal.
UPDATE: I told my mum and am now at my partners house. I told my mum and she stormed out and came back 5 mins later asking if I had stuff at my partners house. She walked me to my car and told me to have a long hot shower and to call her as soon as I get here so she knew I was okay and that she would come and pick me up later. She also told me that I will never have to see him again.

Unfortunately my partner is on the other side of the country at the moment and won’t be back until this time tomorrow but he has already offered up our house to my mum and brother.

I don’t know what’s going to happen next but I wish that I could thank each and every one of you in person. I never thought that I would be in this position and your advice was everything I could have asked for and more. 

More importantly, your words of support and encouragement...there aren’t the words. To think that an online community provide someone so much strength and courage is beyond me, and I thank each and every one of you for helping me. I don’t know what is going to happen next, but I wouldn’t have gotten this far this quickly if it wasn’t for you."

We are regularly (maybe once or twice a fortnight) woken up around 4:00am by a very distinctive and rhythmic thumping noise coming from the bedroom of the apartment under us. At first I assumed my neighbors were building a sturdy bookshelf, hammering and pounding nails into wood with great gusto for about 5-10 minutes at a time, but I have begun to suspect this noise is in fact a headboard bumping against the wall during sessions of early-morning coitus.

What can I do about this? I’m not great at falling back asleep after I’ve been woken up, so this is really killing my sleep schedule. We’ve tried running an industrial-sized metal fan in the room, a white noise machine, both at the same time - neither can mask the deep bassy vibrations of the passion downstairs. 

Due to the sensitive nature of the supposed activity, I don’t feel super comfortable approaching the neighbors. What am I even supposed to say to them? “Hey, that thing you’re doing at 4am - can you do it quieter, maybe?”

Any advice appreciated. Thank you!

I have aluminum rims, and live in a cold place so i thought maybe it was just because of that. 

But then i got a phone call from a car dealership in my town, replying to a phone call that someone left them. Someone left my name, phone number, and car model at the dealership. I thought it was one of my friends playing a joke, but they all denied it. 

I worry that it is my old friends abusive boyfriend; a couple months ago I admittedly freaked out on him for being a weirdo creep. I haven’t spoken to either of them since then, and my friend stayed with the guy.

Then I spot something else she dropped. A Best Buy corporate ID. With her face on it. The idiot DROPPED HER WORK ID. 

I filed a police report and the cops have the ID now but I took down her name. 

Basically I want to know if it would be completely inappropriate to call up her boss at the Best Buy corporate HQ and let them know what's up. Or at least let them know she won't have her ID for a couple days. 

Any insight is appreciated! Thanks!"

I just found out she works at my new job. Do I inform management now or later of my refusal to work with her on a given job? So about a year ago I was working a multi-day freelance gig, setting up for a huge concert production. On the first couple of days, these 3 riggers were in charge since we were mainly doing all of the rigging. First of all, I've never had to redo the same job over and over so many times because they just did not know what was going on and kept telling us the wrong way to do things. Enough to where everybody was getting seriously pissed off at all of the wasted time. But my main issue is that one of them almost sent me to my death (we will refer to this person as R).

We built and erected a 50' truss tower and after it was up they realized they were missing a piece at the top so we needed to drop it back to the ground. Now usually you do these kinds of things with a chain motor, we did not have one for this tower. So we were using a long rope and a bunch of people to stand them up and drop them. Normally when standing or dropping a truss tower of this size, theres a pivot point for the chain so that the motor can effectively raise or lower the tower, we did not have one of these either. So as they're lowering the tower, R told a coworker and I to ""stand under the truss and when the people on the rope slowly lower the tower, I want you to get hands on it and help lower it down slowly."" I immediately looked at my coworker and told him, ""dont you dare step foot near that truss because I already know that truss is going to come crashing down."" Sure enough, when that truss passed about a 45° angle and the people on the rope lost tension,
 the tower comes crashing down with enough force to bounce itself about 6' off the ground. I immediately went to my boss for the company I was freelancing with and explained to him what just happened and demanded I be put on a completely different task as I would no longer accept directions from R or any of the other riggers.

Fast forward to now, I've started working at a different company full-time and it turns out that R works there as well. R is not in my department but chances are one day we'll be working on the same job together. So do I go to management now to inform them of what happened and to never put me on a job with R or do I just wait for the day to arrive and bring it up with management then? I still refuse to work with R. If it hadn't had been for me being able to see what was going to happen that day, I'd be dead right now and so would my coworker. He didn't even realize what was going to happen until I warned him.

I also want to clarify just in case theres any confusion, I have absolutely no issue that we work at the same job. My issue is that if management comes to us and says, ""hey, go set up for this show"" and R and I are on the crew together, I will NOT take direction from them. 

Tl;dr; supervisor from freelance gig gave me instructions that would have got me killed. This person works at my new job. Not sure whether to inform management now or later that I refuse to work with them.

My girlfriend and I got into a heated argument in Vegas on the strip. Mean things were said by both parties. She ended up kicking me in the ribs twice while I was sitting on the ground. Without knowing what was said, because we were both drunk, is this abuse? I can’t imagine ever doing anything like that to her, no matter what she could possibly say. My ribs have been bruised the last week and I can’t help but feel like she would have left me had I done the same to her (and I wouldn’t blame her if I did.) Am I crazy for thinking like this or wanting to be with her still? 

Thank you for any advice you’re willing to give.

EDIT: Thank you for all the responses. It helps to know I’m not crazy for thinking if the tables were turned it would be a way bigger deal. We’ve been together almost 5 years, it’s really hard to let that go. Yes, she’s cheated on me before and we’ve had trust issues since, obviously. This is the first time she’s ever assaulted me like that. She has pushed me or slapped me before, but nothing close to this. She really is my best friend and I know the alcohol is partly to blame, as the only really heated arguments happen when we’ve both been way too drunk. We both have anger issues, when I get too drunk and upset though, I’ll take it out on a wall or break something (infrequently I should mention,) never once been physical with her, I just can’t imagine ever doing it. Idk what else to say at this point because we’re both committed to trying to make it work and not drinking like that anymore. Her name is on the lease with our other two roommates for the next year so we basically have to ride it out at least until then and have the next year to work on our issues.

This girl is a volunteer and she's 19. She's been volunteering in the lab since July. She's really keen, capable, and smart, and our supervisor put her with me so I can show her the ropes and have her help me with my project where she can. Our lab is super chill, everyone gets along, jokes with each other, talks about life stuff, shows up and supports each other's outside endeavours, and is easygoing about everything. I mention this to set the general atmosphere of the lab, to establish why we have all have each other on social media and text each other and why it isn't weird for certain topics to be brought up in lab, etc.

Here are some things that have happened:

-she sent me an ""accidental"" nude

-she sent me an ""accidental"" sext paragraph

-she left me a drunk voicemail, and often texts me while drunk

-when we're working closely in the lab she'll take a deep breath thru her nose and talk about how I'm making it so she can't concentrate because my cologne smells so good. It's kind of a running joke she has now.

-i get a stiff back when I'm doing work that has me hunched over and she, apparently, has taken a massage course. I've stopped mentioning when my back hurts in lab rather than continuing to politely extricate myself from her attempts to massage.

-one day all of us were eating lunch and one of the women in the lab mentioned that her boyfriend has a major foot fetish, and everyone started talking about it (some saying feet are gross, some saying they've dated people like that, etc) and they asked me, the only guy there, what I thought about it. I, honestly, said that I don't have a full-on foot fetish, but that I can see the appeal; and sometimes, especially in the summer when my wife's feet are all tan, feet can be a part of foreplay. Or something like that. Ever since then, this girl has been foot flirtin' like Phoebe. I've lost count of the number of times since then she's found ways to put her preternaturally tanned bare feet near me or on me or in my line of sight. The most egregious of which being a few days ago when she said something like ""one of my friends sells feet pics on twitter and makes so much money - do you think my feet are cute enough for that?"" and then proceeding to put her bare feet up on the inside of one of my legs and wiggle her toes perilously close to my dick.

-she's mentioned how she doesn't have a gag reflex like five times since July

-she talks a lot about one of her friends who is fuck buddies with a much older guy. like telling stories of their escapades. and often talks about how she's jealous of her for it and wishes she knew how to find one herself

-she's the first person to watch my insta stories literally every time, and once she liked a picture of me shirtless from 2014 that was waaaaaaay back in my feed, but she's never liked any other old pictures. She also occasionally watches the first story in my wife's feed and nothing else - she doesn't follow my wife on insta.

-one of her friends who I think I was briefly introduced to in the summer came up to me a little while ago and started talking to me, knew my name, knew things about me. Kept asking questions about my wife, asked if we were poly, and mentioned like three times that her friend (the girl this post is about) hasn't hooked up with anyone in months. It was such a surreal conversation.

-There are other things, like always bending down in front of me when she's wearing a scoop neck and no bra, fixing my hair or collar for me before going into presentations/meetings, constant eye contact, catching her looking at me when I look up from my work, doing yoga on break in the lab (I have a yoga mat and lacrosse ball in the lab for my back) with heavy focus on poses that have her ass pointed at me, she asks questions all the time of folks in the lab about whether they know if anyone ever fools around in the labs, and many many compliments of my clothes/hair/beard. But a lot of these could just be coincidence or confirmation bias, and the scoop neck and yoga ones could just be me being an old perv and reading too much into it. But the down-shirt thing happens a fucking lot...


So like, yeah, I'm *pretty* sure those are the clunky romantic advances of a teenager.

Here are the things I do:

-I mention my wife all the time to her. Like a lot.

-I one-worded her after the ""accidental"" texts, and never respond if I know she's drunk. In fact, for the most part, I don't respond to any texts that aren't work related, and if I need to initiate a work conversation with her I usually do it in our lab group chat.

-I always decline the massages and invitations to hang out alone off campus. 

-I never like her thirst traps on instagram. Shit, I never like her selfies on instagram even.

-I play dumb when she says things like the gag reflex stuff or other blatant attempts to have sexual or flirty conversations when we're alone.

-If she mentions her friend with the older guy I talk about how inappropriate I would feel in that sort of age gap (one time she said ""it's so much hotter if the guy thinks it's wrong"").

-I don't do anything even remotely flirtatious, no teasing, no compliments of her physical appearance (I do praise her work when she does good work - which is a lot).

-I've suggested to our supervisor that she might benefit from being put with someone else in the lab to see other sorts of research to no avail.

I know that a lot of the replies to this are gonna say she's sexually harassing me, or making comparisons to how it would be handled if the genders were reversed. I know a lot of people are going to tell me that I have to have a stern, serious conversation with her, or talk about it with my supervisor. 
But fuck man, the best case scenario there is that it would humiliate her, and the worst case scenario is that it ruins her reputation in our department if our supervisor got wind of it... AND it humiliates her. She's such a smart and hard-working person, she could honestly be the superstar of this lab in a couple years.

I tell my wife everything about it, and she's also a proponent for going easy on her, though she didn't take the ""accidental"" nude very well. Her suggestion is playing dumb and being unsexy. (*Off topic, but, based on some of the insights she's giving, I'm pretty sure in undergrad my wife tried to bang a prof before she and I started dating....*).

Is there anything else I can do? At what point do I need to get serious about it? Is there a way to be serious about it while giving her the social leeway not to be embarrassed?

**tldr**: A student in our lab with whom I work closely seems super into me, and I'd like to figure out a way to kill that in its tracks without humiliating her or getting her in trouble.


**edit:** a lot of folks are really thinking I should escalate this up to my supervisor and go scorched earth on all contact. The reason I'm not apt to do this, and likely ruin a promising young career, is that 19 is just so young. She's a teenager. Her brain hasn't fully developed, her empathy and impulse control aren't fully formed. I don't want to ruin her over a crush... But all these comments about rape allegations being made against me certainly are giving me something to think about.

**edit2: okay so i've talked to my close friend in the lab about it. she already knew some of it but I hadn't given her all the details. i'm going to document it all to her through email tonight and from now on so there are timestamped accounts. that friend is going to request that the girl in question be transferred onto her project for a bit (and really push for it). that should mean there are no more instances of her and i being alone together. at our next lab function, I'm going to bring my wife along so they can meet and she can see us together. i'm already not friendly through text or social media, so once we never have to be alone together in the lab I assume this can all blow over. if any more sexual texts or inappropriate physical advances happen, I'll bluntly shut them down rather than pretending they don't exist. I'll update if anything interesting happens. Thanks everyone for your help!**

How do I cut my own hair? (Not sure what to tag it, went with personal.)

Alright, whiny angsty teenager incoming. I'll do my best to give a small snippet of my situation. I'm homeschooled, wasn't taught the proper curriculum as my mother had never really cared about it, I've never seen a doctor, never been to the dentist, never had a physical, don't have the booster shots (not sure if I'm really vaccinated, either.)

I haven't cut my hair since I was around 8 years old. It's really long, split ends, it just looks awful to me, and I want a shorter hair cut. I've done my best to remind my mother once a week about it, and she says she wants to do it herself (she won't), or that I don't know what I want, or that I should love my hair because other people would die to have hair like mine. (it's not remarkable, just straight, long, and blonde.) I'm supposed to be going to a community college next Fall, but I don't want to go in looking like I do right now. I want to make a friend and not give off that weird NEET look.

Don't know how to drive, don't know how to do anything properly, really, so I'm not sure how I'd call in for an appointment, especially since I know that my mother wouldn't take me, as my father has called for an appointment before. (She said that she ""forgot"").

Need some advice on how to cut my own hair, I don't want to just wing it, I'm afraid my mother may make me stay at home, skip out on college for that year, or other things that result in ""not going outside.""

**Edit --**  
First, I'd like to thank everyone who commented. With concern, hair tips, or advice in general, it means a lot to me. Even though if I sat and replied to every comment, I'd be here all day. You're all very good people and it makes me happy to know that others are empathetic towards my situation.

The reason why I asked advice about hair and not my home-life is because I'm very aware of my situation being slightly neglectful and abusive, I figured giving a little bit on how my parents refuse to take me anywhere else, it's pretty obvious they won't take me to a hair stylist/dresser.  I like to think I'm one step ahead of my mother in terms of her manipulation and the things she does. Recently, she's been telling me that I've been making her life miserable by asking for a haircut, and I just stay silent. I don't let that shit effect me anymore. I deal with verbal and physical abuse, gas-lighting, all that fun stuff. I'm not allowed to work (I get all my money from art commissions), they aren't letting me learn how to drive, I live very far away from any town, in an incredibly rural area (about 30 miles from the nearest town or 70 for a city? something like that, but I don't live near people).  Yet my mother constantly threatens to kick me out bi-weekly. I don't have any friends to go to at the moment, but I do have one very wonderful person who is going to help me get on my feet once I'm done with college.

I apologize, but CPS will not be called. I care about my father's reputation, I disagree that he's anything like my mother, he's merely being manipulated by her. I don't know why they aren't divorced yet, but I hope it isn't because of me.

This is a throwaway account from my main, as some internet folks know my situation and I don't want them to know my main account. On my main, I frequent r/raisedbynarcissists, it's a great subreddit with amazing people who inspire me to become better, to not let the abuse effect(affect?) me, and to grow as a person.

Sorry for any awful writing or grammar mistakes, as stated before, I am homeschooled and everything I learned was what I picked up from the internet."

His mom said he was really sad all evening about it, he felt embarrassed too and he doesn’t want his mom to make it a big deal. He is in 3rd grade.

She text his teacher last night and she hasn’t responded. She tried to set up a meeting with the principal but the receptionist just took her info and said they’ll have to get back to her to schedule later because they’re testing right now. 

I don’t think that is okay. I feel like she should be more aggressive about demanding a meeting but not sure what the next steps for her should be. I told her I’d ask here since she’s a bit worried and confused. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks
 

Update: she talked to the principal and the teacher was addressed. Apparently they were at a park that is away from the school and there wasn’t a restroom. They talked about how next time they can do better by taking a TA with them so they have someone to assist the kids with going back to school to use the restroom. I don’t know how likely this is to be true but I think she’s gonna let it go for now is what it seems like.  Thanks to everyone who tried to help.

I'm livid and on the verge of throwing up. Apologies for any errors. My hands are shaking - that's how mad and disoriented I
I feel.

 I'm not too close to my roommate, who I'll call Abby. We have our own separate rooms, but we share a bathroom down the hall. We don't talk much, but on the occasion we bump into eachother, she's always very sweet. 

Very early on, I noticed she doesn't contribute at ALL to the apartment. My other roommate and I are always having to clean the dishes she leaves in the sink, and take out the communual trash that is filled with (mostly her) garbage. It's frustrating and we've asked her to do her share of cleaning, but to no avail.

I've been the sole person supplying toilet paper for the bathroom for the past six months. I finally got fed up! This past week, when the last square of communal TP ran out, I said screw it, she's on her own until she buys some for herself. I'll just keep the toilet paper in my room. 

To be fair, I never gave her a warning - but considering she flies to NY every month, I figured she wasn't too strapped for cash that she couldn't fork out three dollars for some TP. 

It's been nearly a week since I've been keeping the toilet paper in my room, and she still hasn't caved and bought some for our bathroom. I figured maybe she has her own stash of TP in her room, no biggie, maybe she's wants to keep her own stash private, too.

I came home from work this morning and wanted to freshen up. I wash my face and reach for my hand towel that I keep on my (MY) shower rack. I'm halfway through drying my face before a rancid smell hits my nose and I immediately stop what I'm doing. It didn't take me long to find shit streaks on my washcloth.I can't describe how livid and violated I feel right now. 

I don't want to assume anything -  but perhaps this was her way of getting back at me for keeping the toilet paper in my room? Or maybe she doesn't have the human decency to know that wiping your ass with someone's personal towel is revolting?

I've been shaking and on the verge of tears. I don't know how long she's been wiping her ass on my towel.

Any suggestions? Obviously I'm keeping all of my towels and toiletries in my room from now on. 

My gut reaction is to want to move out and break my lease because of this. I feel violated. I don't know how I can address this face-to-face with my roommate.

 I live in student apartments - not dorms, but only students are allowed to lease. I am planning on talking to my landlord immediately on Tuesday (I'm assuming the office is closed for Presidents Day.)"

I'm moving out soon and I'd like to take on the opportunity to be a manager and it would help me financially to be able to live with my roommates. Problem is, is that I'm frightened. So here is the whole background story:

I moved out once when I was 16 but i didn't really pay rent just for household items and basic necessities. So it was nothing on my end. I moved back home and I've been living here ever since.

I'm now 18 turning 19 soon and I've had the worst luck with jobs because I always choose places with around 50-70 employees and it has always been drama filled and personally being around a lot of people constantly always made me feel uncomfortable. 

Now that I'm graduated I got the opportunity to live with my old roommate from when I was 16 in their new place with 2 other roommates. 

So i went job hunting nearby since I don't have a car at the moment and It would save me a lot of time stressing out about going home and doing homework for college this fall.

I found a pizza place that was willing to hire me on the spot and I start in a couple of days. When they introduced me to how everything works the GM said that he's also looking for managers so after my 30 day probation if I'm interested he would be willing to consider it. It made me feel super excited.

Why am i scared and filled with anxiety about all of this?:
I've always had bad luck with jobs and doubted I would ever be promoted to a higher position. When i heard this opportunity it made me excited but I'm scared because I've never had a lot of responsibility thrown onto me as much as that. 
With paying bills, going to college and possibly becoming a manager at some point it all sounds stressful and frightening. 

I also plan on going to community college and I don't think I can handle full time as I would be doing part time so I can work and pay the bills.

So i need advice:
-Is doing part time classes okay? My family doesn't see it as a good idea but I think its a pathway that would personally suit me and my situation

-Should I take that opportunity to become a manager? It wouldn't be something I would do forever if anything I want to do something involving video editing and what I actually love doing. (So growing it on the side while I work)

-is it really a bad thing to move out with roommates at the age of 18? Others keep telling me to go for it and others say it's a bad idea, but the one's who keep telling me it's a bad idea are usually the ones who have had untrustworthy roommates and the roommates I have are trustworthy, financially stable and know how to finance (ive also known them for a long time and they're in their mid 20s)

-And well from what you have read what do you think is making me so hesitant because I barely know myself...?"

How can I make money from home to help? Last summer I was diagnosed with intercranial hypertension and 6th nerve palsy. My spinal fluid doesn't drain and builds up creating intense pressure and pain, sometimes paralyzing my eyes, or messing with my vision, and other things. Medication isn't helping keep the pressure level leading to frequent spinal taps. Nothing is keeping the headaches and other pain under control from the pressure. The pain is debilitating and doctors have directed me to leave work and school until things were better, but now the next step is undergoing neurosurgery to implant a shunt. I already know I'll struggle to afford this surgery and am currently living on credit cards to get by as I was only planning on leaving work and school for a short time.  I left my apartment and moved in with my mom and sister. Neither of them work as my sister is disabled and my mom is her full time caregiver.

This a doozy of a read, but bear with me. 

Me and this girl I know have been flirting with each other on and off for about three months. Nothing serious just being playful at work and whatnot, this eventually escalated into ya messaging/snap chatting each other for hours and hours and hours. And we become pretty close. 

Well one night she starts sending me nudes after I make some shithead compliment about her ass, and I consider this to be a step in a relatively positive direction. We keep on talking and snapping each other nudes and whatnot for a few weeks, eventually escalated to us kissing and kinda groping each other whenever we would interact in person. Eventually I tell her I do like her and wanna take her out on a date or just something simple like smoking and netflix+chill. 

She ends up telling me she doesn’t want anything like that and just wants us to be friends, lowkey ouch but nothing too awful. It’s not like we fucked or anything. My heart will go on yadda yadda. I tell her that’s fine and we can still be friends, that I’m there for her if she needs. 

Few days go by and we still talk a little bit but not for the whole day or anything like that. And I’ll be honest, her telling me it wasn’t gonna go any further kind of influences me to not carry the conversations so much anymore. 

She messages me and I don’t respond for a few hours and she says “ just because we’re friends doesn’t mean you get to stop texting me back???” And that kinda pisses me off because I’m just watching Netflix with my phone on silent ffs. So I reply ,” just because we’re friends doesn’t mean I have to text you back that Instant if I’m busy or don’t have a response to what your telling me. That’s not how healthy friendships work”

This devolves into an argument where she says I  haven’t been “ there for her anymore” and I say that I am there for her as a friend but that I’m not going to spend hours on hours devoting all my attention to talking with her anymore. That’ll just make me like her all over again. 

This argument goes back and forth a few times until we both just agree to drop it and that we will talk again later. 

Am I in the wrong? Have I become that which I despise the most? A niceguy?"

Please, help me, I can't take it anymore. (x-post from /r/Vent) I can't take it at all.

I'm a musician and I work doing freelance work. I use platforms like Fiverr a lot to work and such, since they help me quite a bit on getting more costumers.

Lately I got a new client who sent me an order like most people do, which is fine.

The difference is that they have EXTREMELY BROKEN ENGLISH. I couldn't understand A WORD of what they were saying. At all.

Their English is so broken and their instructions were so all over the place I was already anxious from the start. But alright, I tried to do what they said. I did it. And I spent an ENTIRE DAY working on what they asked for, which is PRECIOUS time for me.

And then I sent them the work after an entire day.

And they respond to me saying it's ""Not what they asked for"". And they ask me for something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

They did NOT ask me for in the order. And when I questioned them about it they barely responded my questions properly. They didn't understand when I asked the length of the track they wanted, even. I was already doing a cheaper price for them, and now they ask me to re-make it into something completely different and 100% scrap the other one. After. An entire day. Of me working. 8 hours on this.

I didn't mind and I just did whatever they said. At that point, I was way too done, but you see... You can't just DENY offers on Fiverr.

If you as a seller even TRY to deny an offer on Fiverr you get pretty much punished by the algorithm, you get pushed so far down the Search page it's insane. That'd ruin my work and get me a looot less clients. So I didn't.

I just happily complied. And remade the entire thing. OVER AGAIN. From scratch. With sheet music. Like they asked.

For no extra payment.

And I send it to them again. This time I thought it'd be fine.

Nope.

They once again message me saying ""That's not what I asked for"", and ask me for something YET AGAIN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

I can't begin to explain how broken their English and now none of the orders they asked made any sense.

And they want me to remake it now, yet again. After 2 whole days of working. And they want me to scrape the other two finished works. For no extra payment. And I can't do anything about it at all.

I want to cry so much. I hate this. I'm so stressed out by this it's insane, I hate it so much. The past days were ENTIRELY just ME WORKING ON THIS and it's ALL WASTED because they can't give me a proper explanation. I'm so done. I hate this.

I want a fucking hug."

UPDATE: I feel like I owe you an update. You made me clear how urgent the issue was and how to talk to my doctor. 

A week later I told me doc what you told me, I also did a bit of research. He sent me to a psychologist who then sent me to a psychotherapist. Turned out, I was developing an addiction for alcohol, Energydrinks, marijuana, whatever. I struggled with some inner issues that I wasn't conscious of. I was somehow depressive and has anxiety issues. The therapist adviced a therapy with as less medication as possible. I changed my life completely. I moved away from negative people, started doing what I like and I give less fucks about other people's opinion now. 

During a social program I met some people who already were struggling with heroin, cocaine etc adduction. Drugs can be horrible. Don't know if anyone reeds it, but thank you all &lt;3"

For simplicity we'll name my friend ""Tree""

Tree and I haven't known each other for too long, however we've grown really close over the past couple months to the point where she opened up and told me that her parents; Primarily her step-mother (which we'll name Fee); is abusive. I am a naturally sceptical person so I was unsure what fell under her umbrella of abusive and didn't pursue further for specifics. For what I presume to be her fear of her controlling parents, Tree was very adamant that they her parents couldn't find out that we were seeing each other.

So there are two times I've encountered her.

The first time I saw her is when we were at a parent-teacher interviews. Tree and I were relaxing on the school grounds for a couple hours whilst it was going on. Anyway, Tree gets a call from Fee and demands to know where she is, which in response she tells Fee that shes at parent-teacher interviews. Tree offers Fee to come down and join her at parent teacher interview out of fear that shes onto her. Once Fee arrives, Tree distances herself from me and her entire attitude changes. Tree becomes very submissive and quiet as Fee goes around literally interrogating her friends, to which they note Fee as being ""terrifying"" and ""scary"". I didn't get to talk to Tree again that day.

The second encounter was today. I went to go see Tree after she got off work where we'd hang out for a while at a nearby park, which is what we'd usually do. These times are often short and brief considering the amount of time it took to get to her work, but its worth seeing her. However unlike the other times, Fee emerges from the corner and confronts Tree and I. It was at that moment when I felt everything spiral out of control. I introduced myself in a friendly manner, but Fee goes on about how their trust in Tree was broken. I was stupid and challenged her (calmly of course) trust and how Fee never had trust in Tree in the first place. I turned to Tree to ensure I'm not fucking everything up, and that's when I notice it. The extent of her abuse. I was wrong to doubt her. She had turned white pale, I've never seen anything like it. Maybe it was the fear, but when I asked if I could talk with Tree, she wouldn't talk to me.

The last thing Tree said before she left was, ""Ill see you on Tuesday"". But judging from the gentle(?) tone in her voice, she'll likely be punished tonight. I just don't know what to do to fix things. Tree says she's willing to run away, but shes afraid of what her father will do. There were so many things I could have done to make things go smoother, so many things to make it go smoother.

So I ask Reddit, what can I do to help Tree?

Edit:

Thank you all for your continued suggestions, I've never felt so helpless and guilt so it means alot to me that you'd take some time to share some wisdom. I guess I just feel somewhat responsible for this whole scenario. To clarify a few things;

Both Tree and I are 17.

We live in Australia

Tree's friends and I told Tree to see the school counsellor, but she remained hesitant because she believes that they cant do anything.

I informed one of the teachers I trusted (Without Tree's consent) during the first encounter because she looked distressed, but they had already left before we could make sure everything was okay. The teacher left an email to the counsellor, however this all occurred right before the holidays (which ends in 4 days) so it is likely that they have yet to check up on her.

I'll try to coast her into seeing the counsellor as many of you suggested. Please, if you have anymore advice I always appreciate the ideas.

One more thing I forgot to mention that may indicate how crazy Fee is was that after the first encounter, Fee broke Tree's phone and took away her devices. Meaning I currently have no way to contact Tree nor allowed to visit because; A) Tree's parents lock the door and she doesnt have the key to open it. And B) I dont want to make things worse.

Again, Thank you all."

Whenever we see each other, we always chat and he is very sociable, empathetic, and intelligent. I asked him once if he was interested in joining my roommates and I for dinner, he responded that we wouldn't enjoy his company, and I felt that he was a little embarrassed, so I didn't push the invitation. 

I am thinking of things I can buy him which will keep him entertained, and keep his mind active. He does not leave his house, and struggles to get down the three flights of stairs. Each week we bring his groceries up to his apartment (which he has delivered), and he buys us a box of chocolates 'for our troubles' (sweetheart). 

It breaks my heart to see him alone. Does anyone have any advice as to how I can bring some more joy into his life, without intruding too much? I was thinking of buying him a introductory German book, as he explained that was the language which interested him the most when he was younger. (I am also learning German). 
I also thought of buying him a diary. I'll ask him tomorrow if he enjoys writing. 

Thanks in advance!

Hello reddit.

Must clarify, i live in north Mexico

So my neighbor is an ex-soldier or something like that and he is a big fucking bastard. Idk if he has some kind of mental illness but all the neighbors hate him and at the same time we're afraid of him, so we tend to avoid any kind of interaction with Mr. Soldier, cuz he may threaten us with pulling out his guns if we ever fuck with his stuff.

To give more context, he does things like putting giant rocks next to the sidewalk so no one will park in front of his house. He even painted them yellow so they become the sidewalk... We can't deal with this kind of shit cuz he will threaten to shoot us. 

Anyways, the thing is that he recently acquired five dogs which live in the ceiling of his house, and probably live in poor conditions (cuz they look so)... And i have a Great Dane that every time we open the entrance gate, he goes out and barks at them. I had been making an effort so my dog doesn't do that, but sometimes he can't help it. Every time we open the gate the dogs start barking and he goes out.

This morning my sister came out, opened the gate and the neighbor was out there too. The dogs barked each other and then he threatened my sister. ""I'll pull out my gun"". Idk if he referred to her or my dog, but i've fucken had it with this guy, im so angry.

Tl;dr: Neighbor wants to shoot my dog for barking at his dogs which live in poor conditions in his ceiling. 

Any advice reddit?

She always responds with ""Yes"", ""Oh?"" Or a very obviously fake giggle. Seemingly trying to focus on her work while not being rude to her boss.

Hi,

So I’m a ‘recent graduate’ living at home with my parents in the Midwest to save money. I bring home 2400 a month after taxes and put half of everything into savings each month. Ever since I got my first job my older sister has been randomly asking me to get my nephew gifts. Hell... she even asked for me to help with his daycare just weeks after I had graduated college and hadn’t started my job yet. Today she asked me if I could buy my nephew a teepee ($60) for his newly renovated room. I told her that I couldn’t because I just gave  $200  to our little brother to help him buy his books for college. I’m not sure if I’m being too tight with my money or not? I’m planning on relocating within the next 6 months and I’m trying to save as much as I possibly can.  Not sure what the normal ‘auntie’ protocol is for these types of things :/. 


Edit: wow didn’t expect so many people to comment on this! I’d like to add that I think my sister’s rationale for asking me for gifts is because I live at home and pay no bills (besides my phone bill) and so she knows I have disposable income. But to me it’s the principle of it all that really irks me. Her boyfriend/fiancé just bought a MAZERATI and they live in a 400,000 home and are about to go to Dubai. I just don’t understand why she feels the need to ask me for things like 60 dollar sneakers and teepees when they’re doing so “well”?"

I live with my mother (she has no source of income) and my grandmother in the house of the latter. Last year, I bought a car that I passed on my mother's name from my money. My grandfather died last month, paying me with my house maintenance.

The problem is the following: after his death, I paid the utility bills last month, and this month, respectively. Mother insists on paying them further, refusing to get a job, and grandmother refuses to contribute to utilities. I have a university to pay, plus the personal stuff I have to pay for. My mother nicely told me that if I do not pay, I will get to the stage where I will lose my car because she will not pay off the debts that are on her behalf.

What should I do? The gut tells me to leave the house, find a rent somewhere in an apartment and drive the car in my name (although my insurance will burn because of the price, but I will be able to get through the city and without the car, since I can get where it is needed by public transport), what do you suggest?

So I just started college a few months ago, and I met this guy in my block. He seemed alright at first, but then it turns out he has clinical depression, so he's a needy kind of guy. He'd message me all the time on Facebook, talk to me during class when I'm trying to listen, and for a while, try to get me to hang out with him all the time. I'm not a really a people person, so I soured on this guy real quick (it's such an asshole thing to say, I know). There are other, non-depression related things that really bugged me, such as borrowing my stuff all the time and trying to drink from my water when there are drinking fountains everywhere. But at the same time, I don't want to be mean to him because I'm genuinely worried he might kill himself or something.

Then he started hanging out with this other guy, and I felt relieved because he'd stop being so attached to me, but then they had a falling out, and now he's back with me. Since I'm not in the same course as this guy (I'm Course A, he's Course B, let's say), I was counting the days until finals when we'd no longer be classmates and he could go hang out with someone else. Now he tells me that because of his falling out with the other guy (who is also Course B), he wants to shift to my course. 

I tried to talk him out of it, saying that it would potentially be very stressful and that it didn't match his skill-set, but he's dead set on switching; he's probably going to be my classmate next semester. And he's going to keep hanging out with me.

I understand that people with depression need help, and that this guy is going through a rough patch. But at the same time, I can't help him all the time. Why should I put my life on hold to help this guy I met only three months ago?

Am I a bad person for not wanting to be with this guy? Should I tell him I don't like being around him? I'm really lost right now, and any advice could be useful.

Thank you!"

I guess..I don't even know why I'm posting here, since nobody here can help in real life anyway. I guess I just want to vent or...I just want to hear another opinion..I don't know anymore. I just feel so lost and cold and not sure why I'm still alive anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Me, 29, working 4 jobs living with my 8-years depressed unemployed mother and my finally-found-a-job-after-7-years-of-being-unemployed father. Mom has been depressed for 8 years now. Taking heavy dosage of Xanax and the like every day, and despite my best efforts I can't seem to help her get back up. It's like I work a month on building her up and she finally seems to be getting better....and BAM! something happens...something tiny...like a cat crossing her path ..and she crashes again.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so tired. Been working 4 jobs for 6.5 years now, never once had a vacation.

Not that I'd be allowed to go anywhere alone anyway, or else I might get raped!..or so mom says..if I try to go out somewhere alone she makes a whole scene that leads to a few days of horrible fighting inhouse.

&amp;#x200B;

It was bad till recently...but recently it's gotten VERY bad. Two months ago she started to make huge arguments about how I'm a filthy fucking whore, how I ruined her life, how I betrayed her, how I'm irresponsible as fuck (her words not mine)...and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

That's when I cracked. Till then I still clung to a tiny bit of hope..but something snapped and now I can't work..been fired from one job already after 6 years and about to lose second soon if I don't chin up....can't listen to music anymore which was the one thing that kept me going for ages...and whenever I see something nice or am told something nice I either feel like bursting into tears or into sad laughter as in ""Hahahahaha! Good joke, me? Deserve THAT nice thing? Naaaaaah.....I'm a whore who deserves only pain"".

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know I shouldn't think like this and I try so hard to stop myself but it just slowly sinks deeper and deeper into my mind and I can only slow it down but not stop it...or so it feels.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried talking to a shrink...shrink said mom should be admitted (which she absolutely refuses to, thinking she's the one in the right and everyone else is wrong).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told to abandon her, just leave and save my own life. But...I can't do that. I can't live my life knowing I abandoned the one who raised me so well, my amazing mother (or...well..this is how she used to be before the depression set in) ...in her hour of need. I couldn't live with myself if I did that!

&amp;#x200B;

Recently though she's so aggressive towards me (pulling knife on dad, hitting me, calling me in all the dirty ways possible every day..) and she says she wants to leave - but every time she's offered a paid rental house (I'd offer to pay it) she declares she wants NOTHING from the filthy whore who ruined her life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know anymore.I..don't think I'm a whore..I literally had one short-ish relationship (everyone ran away when they heard about my mom..) and am working so hard every day for us to have a good situation as a family and..I don't know anymore...

Or if I am a whore and a cunt who ruined her life then at least SOMEONE tell me what I'm doing wrong so i can bend over backwards to fix it!"

My rear wheel hub went out and the thing can not move. I’m parked in a city that frowns on sleeping in cars and I currently only have 150 bucks to my name. I asked if the interview can be rescheduled and I’m waiting to hear back. I don’t have anyone in the area who’s able to help and I can’t get to a junkyard without a car. The public transport system is almost nonexistent here. There’s a mechanic shop nearby that might be able to help but that’s if I can get the wheel hub myself and bring it to them. The hang up still is that it’s cold and I don’t have anywhere else to sleep. If the cars in the shop for even a night idk where I’ll go. I’m hanging on a thread and really need any advice. Last time the wheel hub went out it took about $140 to get it fixed at a shop. Which doesn’t leave me room for a rental car of any sort. 
Anyone with similar experiences? How do you recommend getting through? I really thought I had it when they offered a second interview

Some kind soul bought me some breakfast and it’s still warm

3rd update: I love everyone in this thread and will give more details later. I’m sitting on the commode at the garage and my wheel is apart. Junkyards should still be open. If I can source the part, she’ll be mobile by dark. As stylish as my ‘93 Lebaron is, she’s a  bit up in age and hard to source

Quick update: I made it to the hotel and my baby gets her own bed tonight

Post interview: https://imgur.com/gallery/70EJK

I can’t say it enough, and there really aren’t words in my language to describe how I feel. I love all you kind souls, the few negative ones too. This has really been a huge blessing. 
To the kind soul below who gave me that hotel room last night, that was wonderfully refreshing before that interview. Place had a hot tub and sick ass breakfast. 
To all you wonderful souls with the monetary donations, I will not forget this. I got my car drivable but barely. All this income is going to fix the rear up. My brakes, which I found out are leaking and almost gone and my fuel line is also leaking which is pretty scary to sleep over. 
Guys, I love you all for helping me get my shit together. I will, very soon, have it together and when I can I will return this blessing to the next guy who needs it.
I really don’t feel so alone in this now and I’m incredibly honored by everyone’s generosity

I will post another update when I get the final call

Another follow up:
I apologize to all who have been checking in and hitting me up for this late response. I didn’t get the position unfortunately and I keep finding things wrong with this car. I fell into a bout of depression the last few days over it but I have parts on the way thanks to you kind souls. They should be here by the end of the week.
It’s been and still is a long emotional journey for me. I’ve gotten back in touch with my folks and my dad is letting me use his garage this weekend for the repair. I’m grateful he’s willing to help after all this time but I still feel like a mixed bag over going back. 
I owe a lot to you guys and I am truly sorry about this late update. I really feel the concern from you and I’m sorry that I couldn’t come with better news.
Reuniting with my family is possibly where I was suppose to end up all along. So I’ll take that as my silver lining and keep sending my resume around.

I’m stressing this for myself but feel inclined to share. Count your blessings man. I feel low because I see myself low but I can only see through where I am which is low to me. The thing is realizing this feeling is relative only to myself. Glancing at my life through someone else’s could make mine drastically better or even worse and what makes my perception of reality more important then theirs? Not a damn thing, so I conclude that all the shit I go through, although it shapes me, is universally insignificant. It’s not what happens that’s important, it’s what you make of it and how you let it make you. From my view, I’ve not had it any better or worse then any other soul out there, only different.
I’ve had friends leave me, women mistreat me
Mothers fear me, and cancer try to kill me
And in all the shit, I’m still me

I don’t know if I’ll update this post again but feel free to message me if you’re reading this. I’m down to swap stories and gain some new perspective. I always can use some new insight and I know someone out there needs a ear too

I love everyone who brought the positivity and the ones silently praying out there. It’s been real

To improve my resume, a family friend who is a Real Estate agent said that I could include on my resume that I have been her assistant for 7 months, even though I never have. She figured that I wouldn’t be claiming to have very much real estate experience by just being an assistant.

I got a job at a Real Estate office, and it is much more responsibility than I was expecting. Day 2 of the job, they expected me to complete a report and handle clients. I wanted to throw up. I have no idea what anyone is talking about.

I never claimed to have any experience with the nitty gritty of real estate. 

I don’t know what to do. I had two panic attacks yesterday, and I’m afraid that I’ll be just as anxious at this job. I don’t know if I should quit before I fall flat on my face and lose the company a lot of money, or stick it out.

It is substantially more money than I have ever made.

I just started a new job and it happens to be at the same place my husband works. We have been married for many years, a few kids, have our ups and downs but overall pretty stable. 

A few months ago my husband started casually name dropping someone he works with. He was very open and honest and was never gone late nights or doing anything that would seem weird. He’s had female work friends before and I’ve met them and everything was always out in the open and OK. Nothing weird. But a few weeks ago I went to his office and he completely blew past this coworkers desk and didn’t introduce me. Later on I told him it was weird and I had wanted to meet her and he shrugged it off and said my visit was so impromptu that he didn’t want to interrupt her. 

Fair enough.

A few days later he mentioned he needed to go run an errand and as I was coming back from lunch I happened to see her in the passengers seat driving with him. She didn’t make eye contact with me and actually looked like she turned her head like she was trying to avoid me. I asked my husband again and he said they both needed to run an errand and it was just around the corner. Again, he was being very honest and I know just being in the car with a member of the opposite sex is not crazy.

So I bring you to now, where we all work in very close proximity to eachother. She hasn’t introduced herself and is avoiding me. My husband hasn’t introduced me. I feel like something is amiss. I can hear them talking sometimes from my desk and it seems very casual but I still feel like the whole situation is disrespectful. Lots of people in our office have spouses that work in the same department. A lot of people know I am his wife and have introduced themselves.

My husband thinks I am making a big deal out of nothing but I think there is only a few reasons why this woman is avoiding me and not speaking to me but I don’t know how to approach the situation. I don’t want this to become an HR issue and a part of me just wants to put on my big girl panties and introduce myself but I feel like that isn’t going to make the situation any better.

Does she like my husband and now feels awkward? 

Did my husband maybe tell her not to talk to me? He claims he has no idea what is going on and says he too is frustrated but if that was true he should introduce us (which he still says he won’t do because he feels like he doesn’t want to get involved in whatever issue “we” I.e. me and this woman have between us)

Advice is appreciated. I just hate this type of thing. I’m a grown woman and like I said I have to work in close proximity. "

She can normally tell when it’s about to happen before it does.

  So, she began to feel it, and we could tell she was acting weird. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she felt one coming on. We got her to sit down, and she told us to go and work and that it would go away like some had before. One of the employees told me to go back and check on her, and of course I did because it’d be messed up not to. There she was, eyes flickering and rolled back into her head, laid back on the chair, violently convulsing, just barely breathing.

  We called 911 as quickly as possible. She got into the ambulance, and they were able to calm her down without even taking her to the hospital (she didn’t want to go because it’d be too expensive). She came back in and asked why we called. She was angry, and told us we should have let her die and that she didn’t want to live anymore.

  I’m not sure what to do. I’ll feel directly responsible if she kills herself in some other way now. Is there anything I can do to help?"

And there's a chance that I'm overreacting and being dramatic, but I feel what I feel. Also, this is a two-parter, because they're separate, but very related issues. 

##Part 1

So, I had a very close family friend (let's call him Paul, for privacy). Well, my girlfriend's family friend, but I basically live with them, and got close to him by extension. Paul was in his 40s. We all went to the same church (I'm not religious, I just tag along because my girlfriend's mom likes it when I do), he was the youth pastor, he came here for dinner sometimes, and I've been to his house for dinner. He had a PhD in theology and we were scheduled to meet weekly just to discuss things. I'm agnostic, but I still have questions and he seemed like the best person to answer them.

He had been in the process of moving, and my girlfriend's brother (let's call him Will) and I were supposed to help him today (technically yesterday, it's well after midnight now). We were supposed to be there at 10am, and he was expecting us. Will and I got there at around 11:30 because we got a late start and had other things to do first. We knocked several times, and didn't get an answer. Tried the back door, and again, no answer. But his car was in the driveway. All the doors were locked, and the garage door requires a code to open. My girlfriend's mom (let's call her Karen, she was probably the closest to him) called me to see if we were there yet, and I told her what was going on. She told me that Paul's wife had been trying to call him all morning (she was at work with their daughter) and couldn't get an answer. Karen then calls Paul's wife back and tells her what I said, and she gives Karen the code to open the garage. Karen calls me again, gives me the code, and I open the garage door. She tells me to tell Will to stay in the garage, while I go look inside, and if I didn't find anything she was going to call the police. Now, up until this point I was not concerned. But the moment she said for Will to stay in the garage, I knew exactly what was going on. She wanted me to stay on the phone with her while I searched the house. I slowly made my way through the house, peaking into every room. Then I get to the master bedroom. I had the weirdest feeling, and I was shaking almost uncontrollably, but trying to act unconcerned to Karen. I peak in, scanning from right to left. Then, at the very left of the room, the closet door was partially ajar and I could see the right half of a person. It was him. He was kneeling, and limp, and there was something around his neck. I froze. After a few moments I, as calmly as I could in my panic, walked back to the garage. I told her I didn't see anything, and told Will the same. She asked if I checked the closets and the bathrooms, and I told her that given the concern, I just couldn't bring myself to check. I just didn't know how to tell her what I saw. I don't think I could have gotten the words out if I tried. She hung up to call the police. Will and I waited in the car until they arrived. I told them that I couldn't find him anywhere, and he wasn't answering his phone, but I was too afraid to check the closets and bathrooms.

I wanted to protect Will from all of this (he's 17, I'm 21), so I drove him to a store a couple miles away, dropped him off, and then came back. When I arrived there were more police, an ambulance, and a detective. I got out of the car and I asked the nearest officer if something bad had happened and just said ""I'm afraid so. The detective wants to speak with you."" It was nothing serious, but since I was there he had to ask some questions, like my reason for being there, his relation to me, etc. I filled out a statement, sticking with my lie, gave it back to the detective, and I left. I picked up Will, and we came home.

I haven't told anyone that I saw him yet. I don't know how. I know this sounds dramatic, but every time I close my eyes I see him, kneeling, limp, and dead. I can't get the image out of my head. I've been shaky and sick feeling ever since. I can't sleep. I haven't eaten since Tuesday, and it's now Thursday morning. I've never seen a dead body in person, let alone someone so close to me and because of a suicide. I've never even been to a funeral. People have noticed that I'm taking it harder than everyone else, and I don't have an explanation to give them. I want to talk to someone, but I'm worried that it will upset them to know what I saw, or cause them to picture what I saw, or even that they'll be mad at me for lying. What kind of legal trouble could I get into for lying on a written statement?

The most baffling part is that he *expected* us this morning. We've been planning it for over a week. And Karen talked to him last night and the plans were still on. Maybe he wanted me to find his body instead of his wife or daughter? I don't know. I'm just so confused.

What if I had been there on time? What if I had checked to see if he was still alive instead of running away and lying? I know it's inevitable, and useless to blame oneself in these situations, but I just can't help it. Please, give me anything. If it was wrong, tell me. If it was right, convince me. I don't know what to do.

##Part 2

I am very worried about my girlfriend. She has a long history of depression, self harm, suicidal ideation, etc. She has been hospitalized four times, most recently in February.

Four days ago, her friend's brother killed himself. She had only met him a few times, and it still really affected her. It took a few days for it to hit, but Tuesday was really bad. She self-harmed for the first time in over a year, and she became very suicidal again. I had to take her to a psychiatric hospital for an evaluation. And although she sees a therapist once a week, he's currently on vacation for two weeks. Which has got to be the worst timing possible. She had never met someone who later killed themselves, and not it has happened twice in one week. 

This is going to be so much worse for her than Tuesday. This guy was like a second dad. She went to every youth group (despite being non-religious and/or agnostic) just to hang out with him for an hour. She occasionally went to Sunday school too, for the same reason. We even had events outside of the church that we'd attend just to see him. And after seeing each other, every time, it was a hug and an ""I love you kiddo"", not just a goodbye. She looked up to him, and cared a lot about him. He's had a history of depression too, but seemingly found a happy place, and so that gave her hope. One time, after a particularly bad episode of hers, he literally told her ""I need you to promise me you'll never kill yourself. I don't know what I would do if you did. Me and everyone around you would be so unbelievably hurt.""

Like, what is she supposed to think now? The guy that she looked up to for many reasons, but most importantly the fact that he made it out of a dark place and found happiness, killed himself. She's going to have no hope for a happy future, if not even *he* could achieve that.

She's been distracting herself from it all day, but I know it's hurting her. She cries occasionally, and I just hold her and tell her I love her. It's going to get far worse in the coming days. I don't know how to actually help her though, and it scares me. I'm hiding from my own feelings and trauma to try and be there for her, and it's exhausting to not feel what I need to feel. But I happily do it, and will continue to do it. I know I'm not as vulnerable as her to these things, and I know I'll make it out okay one day. But I can't be so certain about her. She does have a wonderful, very crisis-experienced family, an amazing therapist, and she's in a daily IOP program currently for unrelated reasons.

I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I just have so much going through my head. I can't sleep.

My girlfriend is safe and asleep across the room, just to end on a lighter note.

##A Summary of the Advice I am Seeking
- Did I do a bad thing by lying?
- Should I tell the relevant people that I did actually see him?
- If so, how should I tell them, and how *much* should I tell?
- Could I, realistically, have acted differently and possibly prevented his death? Please be brutally honest. If it's a yes, I need to know. I'll just have to find some way to live with that. But a ""yes"" is better than constant intrusive thoughts of ""what if?""
- How do I deal with the trauma I experienced? I can't stop seeing it, I can't eat, and I can't sleep.
- How do I give the best support to my grieving, suicidal girlfriend? How can I ensure her safety?
- Pretty much anything else you can add. I'm kind of a mess right now. 

I know people post about far worse situations than this. But I can't help the way I feel. I know I sound dramatic and attention-seeking, and I'm sorry. I'm scared to talk to people I know about this, because I don't want them to hate me, or think exactly what I thought: that I could have prevented it by acting differently. I'm on a throwaway, so upvotes mean absolutely nothing to me, except that they will bring in more people, to give even more advice. I need all the advice I can get right now. 

If you read this far, thank you, honestly. And one last apology for my whiny, dramatic post. I know Reddit hates them. I just want help and I don't know how to get it. I can't afford a therapist. I have no job (due to an injury), no insurance, and no money. I feel lost and helpless."

So here's the deal, there's this really interesting girl in my college. Who not only is smart, has good grades but also witty and fun to be around. Only problem is that she is herself only around her group of friends, she is extremely shy and defensive everytime I talk to her. It's like I'm suddenly talking to a brick wall, she goes from happy cupcakes and rainbows person to a soggy loaf of bread.. So because of that I haven't been able to establish any sort of friendship with her.

What's more interesting is that, she acts normally around other guys of my class. So why get all shy and defensive around me? Am I intimidating her? She's more comfortable around talking to guys who are like 5'8 (around her height) and lean and look completely harmless. Why I, on the other hand am 6'2 and sorta but not really, buffed  kinda guy.. So I dunno

 You ladies are really hard to understand.. So it would make this random stranger happy if you can give him a game plan here

You guessed wrong, I'm 25 years old going into 1st year medical school and dealing with a strange dilemma where my parents decide to turn off my wifi at 9pm to 8am since ETERNITY. It's so suffocating to live through. There have been so many times where I have had to bus to campus in the middle of the night because to them rules are rules and I should learn my mistakes of not being able to submit my reports or complete group projects before then. These hours don't seem suitable for a university student at all, let alone I volunteer, work, and contribute payment for a lot of their groceries, purchases, and bills. They feel that it would be crazy giving control to a 25 year old access to the internet overnight. God, I don't even play games or watch TV. Let alone my mother is a computer engineer so she locked and networked the modems all herself. I barely use the internet, as I am uptight about how much time I spend on things (\~45 minutes every on phone logger). I wasn't even allowed a cellphone or computer until I was 20 years old.

 I do empathize with their thoughts of internet addiction, but godammit 25 years old, going to med school. It feels so strange with the thought of moving away just because I can't have 24/7 available internet like a normal human being.

TL:DR - Parents turn off internet from 9pm - 8am, but I am 25years old and going to medschool. I have no issues or dependencies with the internet, however I require it to seam through my daily tasks, which my parents knowingly ignore. How do I approach them? Is it petty to move out because of this single issue?

Edit: Wow, I didn’t think this would bring this much attention!
This 9pm to 8am rule has been implemented ever since I was able to use a computer. I should mention that my parents have the modem in their bedroom, so I can’t even attach a second router. For those rbn speculators, my mom does use hard wired Ethernet and I’m thinking a hidden wifi network. She locked all the administrators, requires us to input Mac addresses to every device we have, and possibly even logs traffic.

Sadly, I work as a crisis worker and there are red flags of a viscous cycle. Tbh their helicopter parenting is a gigantic mess and probably worse than my textbook case study on ineffective parent counsel. Of course I am greatful for the roof over my head and support to getting to med school, but I was able to mentally survive this because I trained as a crisis worker and learnt the art of self care and carrying life with a sense rationale and non judgement. Parents worked me hard, harder than ever, never complimented me, looked for only the downfalls, raised me that friends are only a life distraction, received summa cum Lauda in my graduating year and they yelled at me that night because I came a 8minutes 32seconds late (my dad carries a stopwatch, yes) taking pictures with a few professors and said a person late like me should never receive this award. They shut my wifi off for the whole weekend. I know it sounds pathetic, but having no wifi (they control my phone bill and don’t allow data even when I offer to pay) was so miserable because I spent the whole time reading and being ridiculed by them (They won’t let me get my license, nor do they let me carry around my ID). They are principled people and don’t like bending rules or getting rid of them, rationally it makes no sense for example: people usually yell for help when there’s a fire or emergency. Apparently I was taught that I should never raise my voice, because a principle of respect and being mature is shutting up and finding your own solution to their eyes.

I stay right now because I feel that they are going to be hopeless people if I leave them, they’ll never talk to me again and I don’t think my mind is ready to live with that. They are irritating individuals and don’t have friends. Messed up thing is they don’t want any friends, saying that’s too much commitment and time. I’m thinking that’s a reason why they are so out of touch with society. They have nothing or no one to really see a comparison to. Thank you for all the responses and attempts of helping me. I’m probably going to have to move out soon because I’m realizing how barring my goals are and that they monitor whatever I do.

Sorry for ranting. Yes, I complain, but I’ll be able to handle this shit. People like me, do and probably exist somewhere in this world. I hope they know that they’re not alone."

And even though I know that It’s partly because I have crippling anxiety that goes untreated, I know that my childhood plays a part in it too.

I was, and I’m still called selfish on almost a daily basis for caring about myself, giving myself basic needs, and saying no to them whenever I don’t wanna do some stupid shit. They basically bullied me throughout my whole childhood. They called me stupid, rude, mean, &amp; selfish because I was quiet and reserved. They didn’t even think for a second that maybe I was quiet because I have anxiety and to this day it goes untreated, masked as depression according to my therapists. I honestly think that because of how they treated me it’s made my state of mind even more fucked up. I can’t even face confrontation without having a breakdown and I’m a grown woman.

Our parents are absolutely horrible. They are alcoholics, they hit us with belts when they are angry at something, they steal our earned money and so on. They used to only abuse our older brother, they simply used him as a punching bag for their anger, he ran away when he was 18. He started contacting us and our parents but our parents didn't want to hear of him until they realized that he is somewhat rich.

We started talking on skype and our parents would always be sober and nice when we were talking to him just so he would send us money for various things but instead our parents would just waste that money on alcohol. I once logged onto my skype account on our computer and was only able to tell my brother that things were now that good here. Once our parents discovered that  they beat me. So since then I was afraid to tell my brother anything.

Me and my parents are getting poorer and poorer every day even though our brother sends us about 3000$ every month, they waste everything on partying and alcohol and I have to go work in a supermarket to get us some food.

About few weeks ago I used my friend's phone to contact my brother and told him absolutely everything. He said that he will come to visit us when he can and he said that he will get us out of there in no time. He told us to stay strong till then and he will think of something.

I found out that our brother will visit us in exactly 3 days and our parents are not happy with that. Is there anyway I can do something so that my brother could adopt us?"

Why does my brother want a child who doesn't look like him? She has a whole different chromosome and looks just like her mom!

The best way to deal with them is to ignore them, because arguing is pointless. They are dumber than a sack of potatoes about most issues and use circular arguments and ad hominem.

I was not able to complete the 51 question test in the time frame we were given. I assumed I would be provided extra time. I asked my teacher if I could do it later and they said yes.

I stayed after that day with my case manager. He saw me sitting down. My bad with my phone and books were all in the corner. I had absolutely NO way of cheating.

They said nobody else scored that high and accused me of cheating. They said my work doesn’t match up with the problems which is just retarded because I know how to do it in the calculator and I don’t always write down every single step I’m doing because I didn’t have that much time.

So I have a ""friend"" whos son is in his mid 20s. When I first met the mom I helped fix her computer because she couldn't get it to work right (shes a disabled veteran). Turns out her son was talking and sending/asking for nudes of underage girls in chats. I told the mom about it but she ignored it. Well not long after he was arrested at a library (using wifi) asking a girl to meet him so they could have sex. The girl was 12. Turns out it was a sting operation and they had been tracking him for awhile because of his online activity. 

Well he went to prison for a year and was labeled a pedophile. As such hes also not allowed near places with kids such as schools. Now that he is out of prison what he does is go to a homeless shelter for a few hours then goes to his moms house (across from a school) and stays there. 

His mom is very much an enabler and makes excuses for him. She claims the prison sentence was wrong because he was being lied to and didn't know the girl was a undercover person (*duh thats the point). He also dated a 45 year old women and would have sex with her in front of the womans 8 year old child. Creepy beyond belief. He also claims to be a marine because he signed up for the army, and then was denied because he said they referred to him as ""out of shape"". But he still calls himself a marine. Irritating to all my marine friends. 

So my question is who do I contact to turn him in for breaking the rules he has? Not sure if he has a parole officer or not. Though I think he does since he has to report to the officer every so often. 

---UPDATE---
Just called the police. They transferred me to a detective. I was told one of three things would need to happen.

1. The mom would have to come and report him. Which given she admits she protecting him means she won't turn him in. 

2. Tell his parole officer, which I don't know the officers name. 

3. Call the police when I know hes home so they could see if he is there. But obviously unless she lets them in, they can't go in. 

So seems I'm out of options. I don't know when hes there every day and I doubt she would tell me because she knows I don't support what shes doing with him. The other issue we are her only real friends she talks to so it would be obvious he turned him in. And considering hes violent and his mom owns a gun, I'd fear revenge when he got back out of prison. Frustrating. 

Only light in all this is I do recall his mom sent my mother a copy of his court files because she didn't understand them. Maybe we still have that email and I can find some helpful info. Maybe the judge?"

The conversation started normally, she mentioned taking a year before university to try a career in acting. It turns out the reason she messaged me was to get my sister's contact info so that she could ask her to be the bridesmaid at her wedding... to a BTS (famous kpop group) member...  
  
I asked her if she had ever met him and she said no, but they message a lot. She claims that he messages her from his private instagram account.

I asked her some more questions to get a feel for the situation. Apparently she had an ""ex-bf"" that was another celebrity she met one time. She had a picture with him, and I guess it looked like him. She said he later messaged her from his official twitter and they started messaging a lot, though they never met again. Apparently he stood her up 20 times. Then he hacked all her stuff (?), I don't know what exactly ""hacking"" means in her context. She said her engineering friends told her IP went through the darkweb and her material was used on a dating website online without her permission. 

She says that her kpop husband-to-be told her to buy a $1000 concert ticket to the BTS event in September. In addition she said she plans to meet him next week..

I think its blatant shes getting exploited, but I'm more worried that she could be getting targeted by a human trafficker. I sent her a long, careful message explaining why I'm pretty sure she's being deceived. She read it, but no reply yet. 
  
Something tells me she will try to meet them anyway, she seemed very convinced it's really him and that they're getting married. 

At this point I'm not sure what to do. It blows my mind how naive she is regarding this. She's a good student too. 

My plan now is basically to have my sister try to talk sense into her. I'm also trying to figure out what to do should she decide to meet the person. Any advice appreciated"

I'm an introverted, quiet person who suffers from depression and feels lonely some times, not necessarily because I'm actually lonely, but because of some social anxiety and the fear of losing the people I love.

Something Important I got to say is that my friends are the most important people to me, I love them and the 5 close friends I have feel more like a family to me than my actual family because I feel comfortable being myself around them and I can open up easily to them. It was my birthday recently, and they organized a surprise for me, that's the kind of stuff that makes me feel loved and that a have a place in life.

I did a stupid thing, I skipped a class in college and missed the final exam because I was already failing and didn't think it was worth spending more time in the class anyway. I decided not to tell my parents about it and just focus on my grades in the other classes so I would have a good mean anyway. Yesterday, the teacher somehow contacted my parents and told them all about this situation. Needless to say, they got really mad, I get it, it was a bad mistake and they have every right to be upset. What's been shaking my anxiety is the fact that they are treating me (mainly my dad) as a total deception, saying things like ""we used to be proud of you"" ""you are getting everything wrong"" ""you just can't stop being a liar, you don't know what truth is"" ""your future is going to be bad"".

I've been dealing with this and just have been inside the house all weekend, my anxiety is building up and I'm feeling trapped here. It's worst when I got to sleep. When I was a little kid, and I was staying at a relatives house for the first time, I got this anxiety-like feeling that wouldn't allow me to sleep, it was a sign that I didn't felt comfortable and just wanted to be in my house as usual or something.

I hadn't had felt like this in years and that feeling has suddenly come back. I don't feel comfortable living or sleeping here, I feel like a stranger, I feel lonely, I feel anxious and depressed, there's this feeling of emptiness that hurts. I wish I were with the people I love, with friends, just chatting, just being in a calm place.

Before you say anything, moving out or getting out of the house isn't really an option, I have nowhere to go and I depend economically on my parents and wouldn't really know how to face the world all by myself in that way. Sorry for my little tantrum.

It started 3 weeks ago(2 days before my birthday) when my wife told me she was unhappy and wants a divorce. I wanted to try and fix things but she said it was impossible. Over the course of our 4 years together she said she's grown to dislike being around me. Finds me annoying and boring. She says she still loves me, but can never be in love with me again. Our lease ends in 6 weeks, so we don't have a lot of time to divide everything up. But, she's definitely taking our dog.

Less than a week later, I was t-boned leaving work. I suffered a concussion(including memory loss) and multiple bruised ribs. It causes me extreme pain even to breathe. Plus, my car was completely totaled. I had to miss multiple days of work. Considering I need to move into a new place by June, is especialy bad.

And to finish off my 3 week hell, 2 days ago, my best friend(who I've know for 25 years and was planning on rooming with), decided to text my wife and ask her if she'd want to hook up now that we're divorcing. The fucked up thing is he was one of the only people I had talked to about getting divorced so far. I trusted him and talked to him about everything. After that, I told him to never speak to me again.

I didn't know it was possible to lose so much so quickly. I'm in so much pain, both physical and mental. I have nothing left. I have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I'm so lost"

I have a coworker who is always friendly, eager to help out, and easy to cooperate with. The only problem is that she smells like a shit pot on a tuna boat. It's a combination of sweaty armpit, swampy lady bits, and some powerful chemical aroma reminiscent of bug spray. It's gotten worse over time, and I often have to walk away or leave the room to get away from her noxious stink cloud. Unfortunately I'm often partnered up with her to work with clients, where there's no escape. It's so bad sometimes, that one day while approaching the break room, I could already smell her from about 10 feet away from the closed door. When she walks down the hallway, she leaves a musky, odiferous trail in her wake that lingers for an impressive amount of time.


I know I'm not the only one who has noticed. After she left the break room one time, one of the other ladies blasted the whole room with air freshener as if she was trying to put out a fire. But no one brings it up, and we're not a gossip-y group.


I'm not close enough or friendly enough with her to comfortably say ""Gurl, you stink"" as I would with a good friend, and it seems somehow juvenile to approach management about it. And she's such a sweet lady that I really don't want to hurt her feelings. What would you do in this situation?"

Landed in the hospital, conscious, but the effects didn’t hit until 7 hours later. Now this was a while ago but it bothers me and gets me mad every time I think about it. 

So I stayed in the emergency room for 24 hours, I argued I felt fine but slowly I started having less and less anxiety, a bit wobbly, and very social and bored. (Had no phone or any stimulus) . A security guard had to watch my tiny room the whole time, every 30 minutes the guards rotated. At first I pulled up my chair to the edge of the curtained room and engaged in some slurred conversation with an older guard, he was very nice and patient with me as I was talking slow and none of what I said made sense. No problem. 

As night hit, younger security guards started to rotate in, and the rule was they had to have an eye on me the whole time, even while I slept. At one point (when the meds really kicked in) I started hallucinating, I remember everything very vividly but it took me a while to decipher what was real and what was not. I was very in control of what I saw as in if I squeezed my eyes shut it would go away. The hallucinations were spiders, weird animals, and the clown from IT, including the walls and ceilings falling apart. I was not scared after I realized I could control what I saw, I even started talking to the objects like “come here man come chill I ain’t gonna hurt u” it was pretty alright. 

I noticed a guard in the corner of my eye, with his cell phone out, as I rolled over to get a better look his phone went immediately down. Some of the nurses would walk by my room and stop for a second to listen or see what I was doing. I was in my bed the whole time. as the next security guard rotated in, I heard him tell the new one to “watch this girl she’s crazy and it’s fucking hilarious”. That guard too recorded me, I know this for a fact because when I rolled over so my back was to him he said “aw shit” because he couldn’t see and record me anymore. It was probably about 4 more rotations where the guard would laugh and make jokes to the next guard. finally this last younger guard just full on didn’t care I could hear him laughing and full on recording me. I knew the difference between my hallucinations (cartoonish and unrealistic) versus reality, as again, it was in my control. 

As this last guard was about to leave and welcome the new guard I heard him laughing and pointing as to advise the guard to watch out for the weirdo and other things . I was very upset and finally I got out of bed , ripped the curtain open and started yelling WHY ARE YOU RECORDING ME THATS NOT YOUR JOB, as I was crying. This guard didn’t deny it and just stared at me. A nurse came and I told her what happened and she started defending him saying “guards don’t have cell phones” which is very incorrect because every single one was bored on their phones at one point. She told me I was just paranoid, which really set me off. I basically told her to fuck off, she dismissed me so easily. 

I am a suicide survivor and these guards just used me as entertainment, which I’m positive is ILLEGAL. all the nurses were rude the whole time I was there, I asked for hours on end for a piece of paper and pencil to draw, each said ok and never came back. 

I knew for a FACT that these nurses and guards were not doing their job, even so that what they were doing was very wrong. I told my psychiatrist who is also in the same hospital, I told my dad too and I just got dismissed. 

I wasn’t taken care of and was treated like my mental health wasn’t as important as anyone else in emergency. 

I may not be able to do anything now but it’s nice to vent. Any advice? "

I have just turned 25 and feel like I am really failing at life. I have suffered from anxiety, depression and panic attacks since I was 12 years old. I have also recently been diagnosed with Responsibility OCD (I worry excessively that I will harm others). I have had CBT, every antidepressant under the sun and counselling. Nothing seems to help. 

I have a First Class degree and my undergraduate dissertation got published in a peer-review journal. I left Uni with every to hope for. And here I am, 2 years later, completely lost and struggling to function. I started a Masters last September and have had extenuating circumstances for an exam, which I am due to resit this January. 

I have achieved well on all other components of the Masters. I only need to pass this exam to get a good level Masters. 

And yet, when I try to revise, I end up vomiting, having panic attacks, self-harming and end up having to abandon any effort to do so. It's so so out of proportion - I only need to pass! And I know I know my stuff. It's like my mind is saying ""nope, not today!"" and every time I try and overcome the darkness of the black mood I am currently under, anxiety rears its head and makes me stop. 

My living situation has not improved over the last two years. To save money, I have lived at homes with my parents whilst I did my MSc. I have previously had a good job as a wellbeing tutor, but my OCD became so paranoid about saying the wrong thing to a young person, that I ended up having to leave in November this year. I currently work in retail, which crushes my soul as I know I should be getting jobs like all of my friends (who achieved less than I have done academically). 

My parents try their best. But my mum is an alcoholic and the house is small. She was abused as a child, and has been diagnosed with Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. She recently lost her best friend, and this has impacted on her drinking and she constantly drinks and starts arguments with my dad. I feel like a child holed up in my room studying trying to drain out the noise. She knocks on the door too, crying and telling me she wishes she was dead. 

I recently read up on Borderline Personality Disorder and it fits me well. Especially the combination of hearing voices sometimes, feeling ""not real"", self-harming, meeting up with men for sex off dating apps to ""feel real"" and then experiencing intense shame and disgust with myself, wanting to die, and not achieving much. 

I am now panicking again - I am about 4 weeks away from an exam I know in my state I cannot do. I am at a loss of what to do - I don't think I will ever improve - shall I just leave with a PGDip? I feel like such a failure. But I cannot live in this environment indefinitely, feeling the way I am feeling with my mum, I need to get in the real world, get a proper job I enjoy and be a normal adult. I feel like I have messed up my life; I could have achieved so much, but I haven't. 

What would you all advise me to do? 

How can i do the exam? \[sad\]"

Of course, it's a long complicated story. But it started a few months ago when my girlfriend surprisingly tested positive on a pregnancy test. As two college students in our 20s, we were NOT planning for this whatsoever. And, by the time we knew, abortion was no longer an option. We had been talking to an adoption counselor for sometime, but as my girlfriend's pregnancy progresses, her bond with our child is growing, and she's pretty adamantly against adoption at this point.

I'll soon have a degree in Music Composition, and with it, a whopping debt of over $50K. Naturally, I had planned on living extremely modestly for a while to pay that off. But I don't feel confident that I can raise a family well with a job this degree can offer me... As for my girlfriend, she will have a degree in Philosophy, and of course, its not known for being a massive payoff either. Fortunately, she won't have near the debt I have, but I'm still concerned that we are going to be extremely limited in our parental investments with such dubious career options.

With this in mind, I feel that I cannot raise the child on my own terms. I felt much more comfortable trying to find a loving home that can provide a good education and meals for our child.  And I don't think that's on the table anymore, so I'm really concerned about the options left to me.

I don't think I can leave her and the child and be able to sleep with myself at the end of the day. All my instincts tell me that I HAVE to be a man and decide to suck it up and raise the child.

But.... I really don't want to raise a child right now. Not only do I think there are better parent candidates out there for our child, but I still feel that I need to focus time on my career and growing as a person in this stage of my life. I'm worried that either my career would suffer as a result of raising the child, or that the child would suffer because of my intense focus on myself and my career. Neither really seems fair.

I love my girlfriend very much, but the options left to me seem really daunting. I don't know if there's somebody out there who's had a similar experience that could lend some words of wisdom. I'm having a really hard time deciding what to do with my life right now, and while a forum is definitely not a place for me to base my judgments, I feel that I need some new input on my situation to freshen my outlook. 

So... What have you got for me, Reddit?

Sometimes I write, but I honestly don't have much inspiration for it, even though it's really a thing I enjoy doing very much. I think it is the only thing I really love doing at the moment, but haven't done propertly in months because of being unmotivated. I'm on my phone the whole day, and I don't do anything besides scrolling the web and watching Youtube videos. When I try to do anything else, I feel exremely unmotivated and like I'm wasting my time, even for the things like watching a TV show, listening to the music or reading books, and even studying. I also feel extremly insecure since a lot of people my age do things that make them happy, while I'm just laying in my bed doing nothing, which also leads me to other problems that laying in your bed the whole day makes you go through, like being overweight and feeling kind of anxious because of overthinking and time itself. I've been like this for a good year and I really hope to change. Do you have any advice on what to do? How do I make myself more motivated? Which new things should I try to do (hobbies, new skill learning, studying), that could potentially turn out into something that takes most of my time without me feeling guilty? Can planning out my day/routine help? Anything on this topic could be useful, and I'd also be happy to hear if other people experience stuff like this and how they battle it. Thank you.

Help? Me and my girlfriend were hanging out last night for our monthly home movie night, and because alcohol was involved I stayed the night. Nothing atypical with a relationship here, the next morning when me and my girlfriend were cuddled up together, I had a hand of mine on her breasts. 

Her roommate happened to walk by (the door didn’t get closed all the way and the cat nudged it open over night) at the time I was doing this, and she basically intruded my GF’s room, yanked me out of her bed, and started screaming at me how I should “never touch a woman like that, that’s assault”. I told her we both do it to each other all the time, only she just runs her hand down on or near my crotch region. 

GF’s roommate isn’t buying my story, and kept lecturing me about how it has to be consensual, and told me to leave their house, and not to come back. I didn’t want to escalate things, so I packed up my things, and started leaving without saying much more. I didn’t want to make it seem like I was upset with my GF, so I scribbled a quick “I love you babe, xoxo” letter and put it on the pillows I slept on overnight. 

Anyways, I’m now getting ready for my afternoon class, and I got a text from my GF asking why I left so soon, and she added that she was going to cook breakfast for us. I explained to her that her roommate saw us doing our usual cuddling, and that I got kicked out of the house. 

The GF is currently trying to talk this roommate of hers down, but it’s sounding like it’s to no avail. The main argument her roommate brings up is that you cannot consent in your sleep, and that it was sexual assault, she’s also threatening to turn this over to the police. 

Our main argument is that we’ve done this back and forth to each other, it’s no different than spooning with a partner, and we like to keep the romantic flame burning. 

As I said before, our points aren’t getting across to her roommate, and I’m now barred from coming over.

So a little bit of a story. Sorry if it’s a little long.

I live with my parents and my older sister (she’s almost 18, I’m 15). She and I get along really well for the most part, and we hang out pretty often. A couple nights ago, she came to my room and invited me to come watch a movie with her. It was close to 10pm and I was pretty tired, but I accepted cause I never turn down a movie. It was weird she was inviting me that late but I  didn’t think to much about it.

We were in the living room on our couch under a blanket, we had the lights off, and my parents were upstairs. I was cuddled up to her, which is pretty common for us, and just kind of dozing. I wasn’t really keeping up with the movie but I was enjoying her company anyway.

At some point, it must have been about an hour in, she puts her hand on my chin (gently) and kisses me on the lips. I didn’t fight her at first, I didn’t really know how to react. She kisses me a little harder and puts her hand on my breast. The whole thing was pretty gentle. It didn’t feel like she was forcing herself on me, I guess. I pulled away and asked her what she was doing. She didn’t say anything and darted away back upstairs and slams the door.

This was about three days ago, and she hasn’t talked to me since. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared to go to my parents because I don’t want her to get in trouble. I don’t know how to feel about any of this. Was I molested? Am I overreacting? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.    


  
\*\*\*EDIT: Thanks for the responses everyone. I didn't expect for this to blow up the way it did, but I got a lot of good advice, which is great. Since I didn't clarify in the original post, I'm a girl, if anyone's wondering.   


I've decided not to involve my parents in this right now, and just have an open talk with my sister about it. I don't consider her dangerous or anything, it seemed really gentle when it happened, like I said. Some people brought up that she might be sexually confused. I didn't think about that but it makes a lot of sense. It's pretty late where I am, so I'm gonna bring it up to her tomorrow. Some of you guys mentioned an update, if people want one, I can give one I guess. Or people can DM me if they want one.   


Thanks, everyone!"

I have a boyfriend who is 2 years older than me and we have been together for 3 and a half months.  I’m a sophomore and he’s a senior. I’ve been over to his house a couple of times so we have done things together which everything we have done together was my first time because I was inexperienced. We have made out, he has given me hickeys, fingered me, and gave me head as well as I have him head  but we never had sex because I was a Virgin and wasn’t ready for that. Before we did any of those things I just listed he has always asked me if I’m ready multiple times because he wanted me to be as comfortable as I could be. Today I went over to his house after school and we started off watching a movie and then we started making out which led to me getting head and fingered. After that I was on top of him making out and his penis was basically out. He asked if I wanted to make out while it’s out but to be safe he’ll put a condom on because of the Pre cum. I agreed not because I was forced but because I wanted too. Than it was almost at my entrance so in the moment I said I liked it and he asked “ you do?” I obviously said yes and he asked me more times than I could count am I sure and if I’m 100% sure I said yes. So we had sex and I told him to go slow and be patient which he did. Afterwards I just didn’t know how to feel and I still don’t. It feels so unreal like I took so much pride in being a Virgin and here I am losing it. I lowkey feel ashamed and I regret it. He could tell afterwards I did because he said that he feels really bad even though he didn’t force me to do anything. I just wish I could go back in time and not have sex and the way I’m feeling right now I don’t want to do anything for a LONG time maybe not even ever. I just don’t know what I should do. I also don’t feel like I could tell anyone because I will be scolded and I’m embarrassed"

How do I let it go to maintain a positive classroom vibe? I teach adult ESL and sometimes a situation comes up where a student tells me about something they did in the past that isn't acceptable in my culture.  She didn't like how her cat was scratching her children so she ""punished"" it by cutting all it's whiskers off and throwing it into the street.


She told me she knows it was a mistake and she didn't know at the time how important whiskers are to cats, or that they have nerve endings so cutting them causes pain.
Not to mention that simply abandoning a house cat outside in NYC is basically killing it.

I am having a hard time remaining smiley in class knowing that she has done this.  We all make mistakes, but this is so fucked up.


Edit: to respond to some popular trends in responses, I do my job regardless, and this issue doesn't keep me from being professional.  I wanted more advice on how to not let it get to me, or stress about it.


Reporting her or trying to punish her, I don't think I'll go in this direction as she did she she will never let animals in her home again.  And the class is at a nonprofit meant to reach out to immigrants at a place that doesn't turn anyone away.  Some women at the school have to lie to their family to be there because it's a woman oppressive culture, and I don't want to infringe on the organization helping people.


I don't think she's a bad person...I think shes just ignorant.  I had a similar issue with a student of mine at a session at her house when I saw a cat with a leatherharness digging into his skin and tied to a four wheeler on a leash 24/7.  I helped her cut her pet free and gave her some training on how to care for him and she followed all my directions.  She just didn't know it was wrong"

Finally finished and feeling depressed about not being a kid anymore. Not ready to accept being a ""grown up"" yet. I could really use some advice/stories about transitioning to adulthood. Thanks in advance! TL;DR: I've been a perpetual student, intimidated/depressed with the idea of becoming an adult and no longer having the structured school environment, finding a career that I can be proud of and starting a life outside of my comfort zone. 




I've been in school for a while now. First got a marketing diploma - didn't click with me much took a year of finding jobs and twiddling my thumbs before deciding to go back to school for an accounting diploma. I liked the business side of things and the idea of managing time/people and resources. Graduated and worked for 2 years doing bookkeeping. Most jobs I found were nothing more than attaching invoices to purchase orders and data entry. It was awful and I was worried that I had made the wrong career choice. I then heard that most of the aspects of accounting that I enjoyed from school required a degree in the real world. So I went back to upgrade my diploma to a degree so I could qualify for a CPA and be given actual work that I could take pride in.


I'm now finished upgrading my degree. I've been in school so long that it's kind of crazy to think that I'm done. The idea of finding a full time job is exciting and scary. Coupled with the pressure to move out and find someone to start a life with it's a lot to take on... I've been depressed/stressed lately trying to come to terms with it and I could really use some advice to help adjust and adapt to the new lifestyle I'll be starting.

Any pointers/suggestions/stories could really help me now and are appreciated.

Thanks in advance it really means a lot.

I don’t believe in an afterlife.  I don’t disbelieve in one either.  It’s the kind of thing where I’m hoping that a type of afterlife exists, but I feel like it doesn’t, and that the only reason people believe in an afterlife is because the idea of there just being nothing after death is too terrifying for them to accept.

(16 and trying to think about college and everything else) Hi reddit, I’m sixteen years old and I’m supposed to have my life planned out already. I’m in the health pathway at school to learn about careers geared towards health but I have no idea what I want to be or if I even want to go to college.
My mom has been abusive in the past, and I go between wanting to kill myself or wanting to make her proud. There is no in between. The rest of my immediate family understands because she’s the same with them but I’m told to just “deal with it”. She has bipolar tendencies and makes me hate myself a lot of times, but my family refuses to get her help. They may be able to just “deal with it” but I’m the only child so I get most of the problems with her rather than towards my dad or her mom. She’s convinced that everyone is working against her and that I’m “damaged goods” for being adopted and not being the straight A asian kid she wants. She preaches that I need to listen to her because she’s my mom, which I do agree to some extent, but she harassed her own mom and came to the point of physical assault once or twice. Because of this, I’m having a crisis of going to college right after highschool or just moving out. Money is tight, so I don’t believe that both are possible.
And on to the topic of college, there is a lot of pressure in my school to already know what we want for our careers. I wanted to be in the medical field, but I’m super shy and it makes it hard for me to deal with people and it didn’t seem interesting after a while. At one point I wanted to be a teacher because I like teaching and I’m ok with kids, but I’d have to deal with parents and if I get a particularly rude one I feel like I may just fall apart and not be able to do my job. Mental health is really important to me so I was thinking of being a psychiatrist or something to do with psychology but my mom said that it deals with a lot of crazy people so I’m not sure about that either. I’ve also wanted to be an artist or a writer but I have no idea what I really want to be.
Overall, my mom wants me to be an internist. If not, she tells me it’s ok to do whatever I want as long as it makes me happy, but then she ends up convincing me that whatever career I’m thinking of is not a good choice.
So now I’m just confused and worried that I have no idea of what I want to do with my future. I’m not sure if any of you guys have advice for me, I’m really sorry if this is super long.
(Sorry if there’s any grammar or formatting errors)

Edit: thank you so much for all your advice! I love reading all your comments and this is helping me a lot. So far I think I'm going to focus on what I'm doing now so I can have a good future (whatever I decide on later). And regarding my mom - she is still nagging me about my future but if I can't do anything to get her to listen to me from my pov, what's the point in considering what she says about my choice of career, I guess. Once again, thank you so much for all the replies on this!"

My sister is pregnant and all the family are really happy and excited. The only weird part of it is that she claims it was from a one night stand. Normally she tells me everything about whatever relations she has but this time she has been weird about it. 

She made a joke during Christmas dinner, she said ; ""honestly it could even be *bfs name*"" he looked really guilty after she said this but everyone just laughed it off 

This is when it clicked in my head, I have been thinking about it since. Around the time she will have had sex to become pregnant will of been when my boyfriend (of 6 years) got super drunk with her at a family party that I ended up having to work through. Ever since then they have been extra close with each other. I assumed they had just made good friends that night.

But that's not all, now I think about it he has been very happy to drive her to all the doctors appointments. I have also seen his bank statements and can see he often sent her small amounts of money. I asked him about the first few but he just said she needed it and brushed it off. But I have checked and he has sent over £500 in total!

I believe he wouldn't of done anything but I just don't know. Now it's all I can think about. Is there any way I can ask him without literally seeming insane."

This is a long one. 

I grew up in an abusive household, both emotionally and physically, but since about 16 years old, things have subsided and my sister (16) and I have been able to coexist with our parents, though none of us are that close. I've lived the past 2 years in relative peace because I go to college three hours away from home, and I expected to be able to live the same way through this pandemic in my dorm. Obviously, with all colleges closing across the country, that plan fell through. I came home about three weeks ago, and my father has become ""unhinged"" over that time. 

It started with him telling me he had a welcome-home present for me, only for him to ""gift"" me a gas mask and two full milk crates of ammunition for the gun he keeps in his office. He said it was ""in case something happens"" to him. I laughed at first, but the look in his eyes was terrifyingly cold. He was dead serious. This odd behavior has only continued since then. Just listing some occurrences:

* He took every bit of food in our fridge and freezer (cheese, microwaveables , eggs, etc.), stripped and threw away all packaging for fear of contamination from others at the grocery stores, and put it all in the near hundred tupperware containers he purchased. He even poured the milk and orange juice into Britas and threw away the jugs. 
* He's begun mandating that we only eat what he cooks in order to ration. My sister and I work around it late at night, but most of the day (from about 6 AM to 10 PM), he sits in the dining room on his computer and keeps an eye over the kitchen. 
* This morning (Easter Sunday), he woke me up for what I assumed was to do our traditional Easter egg hunt, but instead he showed me a fishing pole and said he wanted me to bait the hook with grape halves in order to catch lizards and birds in our backyard to eat.

I was already stressed about the state of the world anyways, but his behavior has worsened that stress. We live in a very nice neighborhood and are financially secure, so I'm not sure where any of this is coming from. Every time I tell him his actions are putting a mental strain on me, he accuses me of hating him as a person and leaves the house. The worst part is I've gone to both my mom and my sister, and they both agree with him. I've been called irrational by everyone in the house and I don't know how much longer I can take it.

I'm leaning towards looking for a friend's or relative's place to stay for a while. I'm just scared that 1) my parents will take it as confirmation that I hate them and cut me off (they pay for my school), and 2) I'll be leaving my younger sister to fend for herself.

My girlfriend is 17 and I am 16, I know that this post may not be taken seriously by some people because of my age but I am really stuck on what to do, and the directions for helping and hopefully preventing these ongoing situations.

Her step-dad will decide to grope her and grab her breasts and genital area for up to around 60 seconds. It happens every couple weeks (from what my girlfriend has told me) and started since she turned 10 or 11. He usually does it by going in for a hug and things like that, and she tells him to stop and hits him but he doesn't.

She finds it so hard to talk about and I am the only other person who knows and we are going to try and speak to her mum about it today.

It honestly breaks me down and makes me feel physically sick to the point where I have migraines, I feel like crying because she is so upset and feels so ashamed that she is physically unable to get her words out. She will say things like ""I'm trying to talk but no words will come out"" and begins to stutter and cry. It sometimes takes days for her to come out on a singular occasion where this has happened, but I don't pressure her into telling me because I want her to feel that telling me is a safe and comfortable option.

Please. I have no idea what to do in terms of, the course of action, how I should comfort her or her mum, what I should say or do to help, and things I shouldn't do or say that can make things worse.

I'm sorry that this post is not up to par with other posts in this subreddit, but I just don't have enough time and feel that my mind is too scattered to form a formal post with good English.

I also don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this to, I'm new to Reddit and if it's not, then please just point me in the right direction.

thanks in advance."

I'm a senior in college graduating soon with a degree in Computer Science. My intention is to go into a software-related position after college, but to be honest, I feel completely lost on where I want to orient my life. I feel like I used to have so many interests as an adolescent, but the tough coursework and intense career focus of my path/university kind of beat that out of me, and I just feel almost like an empty shell now. I no longer feel like I have any of the career dreams I did in the past.

Honestly, the only thing I want now is to find a way that I can sustain myself financially enough that I don't ever need to be part of the 9-to-5 rat-race. Not that there's anything wrong with wanting to have a typical career, but I feel like every job/internship I've worked has been soul-sucking. Preparing for a career is soul-sucking. This isn't what I truly want. This is what I've been groomed to want, and now feel obligated to continue pursuing because 1) It's the most feasible, convenient way for me to support myself financially, and 2) if I leave this life to pursue my dreams, like traveling the world on a budget, or starting a business, then I incur the risk of having an even more difficult time trying to reenter the workforce later on (a lot of software companies question you if you have a year+ gap between employment).

I'm don't think I'm necessarily depressed; but I'm at a crossroads and I'm scared to continue on my expected path as a software engineer because I'm terrified to look back one day and think I let my entire life slip by without pursuing any of my own personal, non-career related dreams. And the worst part is everyone in the US is so career-oriented that I feel like foregoing on career would also affect my personal life: friends, romantic partners, social events; depends on career, directly or indirectly. Sorry to ramble on, and if you've read this far I sincerely appreciate that. If anyone has any helpful words or advice, I'd be grateful for that right now.

TL;DR at the bottom.

Throaway for no other reason than my real Reddit is very public.

I know this isn't as big as an issue as what usually get's posted here, but it's the irrationality of it all that stuns me.

I'm 18, turning 19 this month. I live in London and have had a running issue for the past few years.

I live a fairly active life, like to take care of myself, I'm very social, have recently got into a loving relationship, but I have a father who I genuinely believe doesn't want me to progress in any sort of way.

Flashback to two years ago, I was just starting Sixth Form and had taken subjects I was very interested in. I had been pretty laid back during all of secondary school but still got some pretty decent GCSE's despite partaking in all the things any normal 13-17 year old partakes in, without my father's knowledge mind you, I could never tell him, he's a deeply religious man who's always stressed out about everything and to top it off very stubborn.

That was fine back then, I went through my relationships and first experiences all in secret. I left to goto a different sixth form than the one that was at my secondary school to branch out. 

It was an absolute blast, time of my life. Kept all my friends, and made some more. Genuinely great people. Nearing the second year of sixth form - around 6 months ago - I felt the pressure of A-Levels, got off social media for a while, really knuckled down at home and studied hard. Gained a bit of weight, not too much, but enough that it was noticeable. No biggie.

I should mention also last year around December, I decided to get a part time job so I could go out and stop thrusting my hand in front of my old mans face everytime I needed some cash. In secret, again.

My dad got hip to the fact, and went. Absolutely. Ballistic. He completely went ape shit, I kept going, I told him I'm an adult, and I can do what I well please. He called me during work 20 - 30 times threatening to divorce my mum, just generally being a complete wanker. None of it phased me. I just hung up like 'lmao k'. He even locked me out of the house at one point.

My mum talked me out of the job, told me to quit. Told me it was affecting her relationship, their is no one I love more than my mum, so, I complied. Quit the very next day.

Grades finally came around, massive relief, got into university, but as I was waiting for them I gained a little more weight, I felt uncomfortable.

I decided last minute to defer my entry to university until September 2019 so I could have a year to myself to focus on my health, and travel, work, and just generally experience the world. Again, I decided this all in secret.

Fast forward to August of this year. Now here's where things get really bad. My dad found out I deferred my university course, got massively angry, tried to apply to universities for me, I got calls and emails about 'me' applying to a multitude of universities, I told all of them to ignore all attempts and that I have already got a confirmed place.

He finally calms down a month later. All throughout September I'm looking for jobs, applying everywhere for a full time position. I get a very promising gig at a restaurant for a permanent position, all kinds of benefits the whole shebang. I'm working on my health, losing weight, got myself a girlfriend who I confide in very much. Once again. All in secret.

He finds out, inevitably, takes my travel card, my phone sim card, which I can't do anything about. He paid for them, the only thing I have is my phone. 

Now it's mid October, I'm sat at home almost everyday doing nothing. I've gained back all the weight from sadness. My old lady is trying her hardest bless her soul, but I told her I need to find a way out of this alone and that she should focus on bettering herself as a person too. 

I want to be the best version of myself I can be, but for whatever reason the old sod won't let me work, won't let me be a proactive member of society, won't even let me leave the house. 

It hurts me so much when my friends ask me to go out to do something, or I see them out and about having fun, and I'm stuck at home sulking listening to Knights of Cydonia, and Playboi Carti - odd mixture I know -.

I've tried talking to him man to man, even had conversations with his business partners who sided with me, but to no avail. They literally sat there looked at him and said OP's dad, what is your son actually doing wrong? To which he did not reply.

Their aren't any parts of this I'm hiding, I work hard, I don't drink at all, I don't smoke, don't do drugs. I like to read, make films, appreciate art. I'd say I'm an okay chap. I just don't understand why my dad doesn't like me.

I appreciate any help.

Edit:

TL;DR: My dad won't let me work at all after I took a gap year before university. He won't give me money, he won't let me leave the house.

Edit 2: 

I won't be replying to any more comments, I've had plenty of feedback and an overwhelming amount of support. Thanks to you all, this has been wonderful. 

I'll get my hands on my passport and other important documentation, apply to a job, and try to keep it as discrete as possible. Just until I can get the keys to a flat. 

Woe betide anyone has to go through anything like this, again I thank all of you for your help."

I showed the rash to a doctor, he prescribed a cream, it disappeared in a few days. I'm in touch often with my mom who seems to be responding really well to her cancer treatment. We might have even gotten closer to one and other. I regularly visit the gym and am sleeping a solid 7-8 hours a night.

I just wanted to say thanks to the people who offered me advice and told me not to give up - thank you! This is a great community and you all gave me a huge helping hand."

Ok so I just need to clarify, as this detail is extremely important, that I bought this console myself. My parents paid nothing for this console, because I saved up all my money from working my lawn service job. 

So the problem is this, I go to 5 AM weights and agility at my High School, this lasts until 8:30 AM, and then I go home to clean and sharpen the blade on the lawnmower my boss gifted me. Then I go and work if it’s M/W/F from 12:30 - 6:30 PM. 

The problem arises because they suspect that I spend “too much time playing video games”, and yea, that’s essentially the boogeyman they like to blame. They expect me to “be outside” at all hours of the day, because “had no video games” as a kid. Therefore, they expect me to cut off a hobby that I enjoy just because they didn’t have video games as children. 

They argue that video games are the reason I have eye sight problems. That’s a load of crap, I’ve had these problems long before I ever bought a console, I used to read books a lot, and I still do. 

They argue that video games are going to make me “unhealthy”, again, that’s just another lie. I have a daily weights and agility training session, and I have scholarship offers to play basketball in college. 

They argue that video games are making my grades slip. It’s summer, we aren’t graded on anything. 

They argue that video games is hurting my social life between me and my friends, and my girlfriend. Ok, this is a half truth. My friends and girlfriend are on the same exact routine as me. They all show up to training in the morning, and then go to work, and they’re typically worn out, like me. 

The last argument, and probably my most favorite for how idiotic it is, they argue that I haven’t “done anything all day”. For starters, you were at work all day, how can you tell if I did “nothing all day”? Second off, going to weight training in the morning, and going to work is “doing nothing”? The grass covered socks, and the clothes that smell like sweat are “nothing”? 

That said, these are basically their justification to confiscate my console. When I try to appeal to the dictators, they usually cite one of the reasons above. I asked them why my little sister gets a free pass to watch tv all day, the reason is “well she’s 12!” The irony is that my parents made me get a “job” at that age. 

How do I convince my parents to stop doing this to me? I feel like they’re trying to hold me back because of this, there’s no better stress reliever than playing on my PS4. I get that it’s their house, but it was my money that bought this thing, are they still in the right to do this? "

I have a final update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/68n8hz/were_worried_that_our_neighbor_might_be_dead_in/).

So after seeing somebody in Trevor's apartment cleaning up and feeding the cat, we weren't as worried anymore. Well he showed up back at home yesterday, and my boyfriend chatted with him in the afternoon.

Trevor had left to get himself some help with his addiction. He had started using again (specifically what he was using, my boyfriend didn't ask) but now he believes he has the tools to stay sober and also get over the depression that he has been dealing with.

My boyfriend told him we were worried about him and Trevor was surprised but happy about that. He also said that we're here if he wants to chat or hang out or anything, and Trevor said it would be really helpful if they just hung out every once in a while, shoot hoops at the apartment court or whatever. 

So that is the update. I am very glad Trevor is ok and had the right mind to get himself help when he relapsed. I hope he stays sober, and if you're struggling with addiction or depression yourself please know that there is help out there and people who care about you. Take care of yourselves!"

I tricked my friend into meeting me at a cafe, then we called CPS after a long talk. They did a wonderful job helping. The mom went to a hospital for a week or two, and now everything is fine. They're all doing great and it didn't affect our friendship either.



Yesterday I went to visit a close friend (23) and his gf(21) for dinner. They had a baby a month ago or so, I wanted to say hi. I noticed early that he was really nervous and that there was something he wanted to talk with me about, but he was hesitating. After the three of us shared a bottle of wine and finished eating, they start telling me about all the weird stuff that has been happening in their appartement lately. 

His gf tells me that windows open by themselves, they find toilet paper rolls stacked in pyramids in their bathroom, the santa decorations move around by themselves. The story started our pretty harmless. Then my friend starts explaining about the more violent episodes. Vases thrown into the wall by some mysterious force, knives, plates. He sometimes wakes up because he gets water thrown all over him, etc. His gf provides an explanation (which was supposedly backed by a famous clairvoyant lady in my country): the baby is special, and it has something to do with energy and angels. The energy has latched onto my friend and is following him around, so this also happens when they visit his parents.

My friend was really nervous when they told me, but his gf was unnaturally calm. At this point, I just decide to play along with it, see what happens. And things started happening pretty fast after that.

While we were seated, she went to the bathroom (important detail). I was only there a few hours, my friend and I never used the bathroom. When she was walking behind him to join us at the table, something flies across the room. His ID card for work. I was sitting opposite the two of them, and there is a big mirror on the wall behind them. I clearly saw her throw it. He asks if she threw it, which she denied. I didn´t know what to do at this point, I could see him starting to panic. 

This repeated itself many times. She went to change diapers, then asks him to check the bedroom five minutes later becuase she´s feeling cold. He asks if she opened the window, she denies it and he believes her. She suddenly asks if we heard that noise coming from the bathroom, again trying to get him to check. My friend is hesitating and I´m starting to see indicators that he´s having anxiety and is freaking out, I tell him I´ll go with him. We find bathroom towels thrown all over, and their toothbrushes stacked on top of each other.

He goes to call his parents, and she questions me about whether I believe them now. There was no way I could confront her then and there, the baby was sleeping in the same room, so I pretended to get gradually more scared. When my friend returns and I turn around because I hear the door open, a lipstick gets thrown at him. Judging from its trajectory, it came from across the table from me, where she was sitting. He freaks out and asks if something happened while he was gone, and I figure it was time for me to go home.

While I was putting on my jacket, she is standing by the kitchen sink where a bottle of hot sauce had been the whole night. Hot sauce gets thrown towards the baby bed and rolls under it, my friend loses it completely. She sits down by the table again to calm herself as I put on my shoes, and now her coffee cup smashes into the wall right beside me while I have my back turned.

He wants to walk me to my car, they live in an appartement in the basement. As we ascend the stairs, we hear several big objects get smashed in succession. She yells that it´s breaking vases and wineglasses now and tells him to hurry.

I thought my friend wanted to talk to me outside, but apparently he just wanted me to get out safely. He´s scared witless at this point. I tell him that I don´t really know what to say, but that I´m not as surprised and shocked as I´ve seemed all night, and that he needs to pay attention to detail. The truly scary part was hearing him explain that he has had knives and other potentially dangerous objects thrown at him and close to the baby, found the baby covered in playing cards, towels etc.

This is beyond crazy. I have never experienced anything close to it. I don´t want to lose my friend or put the baby at risk, but someone has to do something. I need advice on the most suitable way to proceed from here. Thank you for reading, and sorry it was a bit long. 



TL;DR: My friend and his gf of 1 year just had a baby. Turns out she is an abusive, sadistic psycopath who´s been torturing him for weeks by pretending to be a ghost on a rampage. He is deeply entangled in her web of lies and shows signs of anxiety/panic attacks. She has fooled his family and some of his friends, or maybe they´re like me and don´t know what to do. I kept quiet all night not to force a confrontation between them with the baby in the room, as I do not know what she´s capable of. Need advice. "

Thank you everyone so much for all your  advice and support. It's honestly made me feel a lot better about the situation. I contacted the family member who i was certain had been sent a compromising pic, and she said she has received nothing. With any luck I will be able to put this behind me and take it as a lesson. Your advice means so much to me, and I will be coming back here over the next week to read over it, as it has honestly made me feel so much better. Hopefully this is the end of it.

Thank you all kindly.

thanks heaps for the advice ya'll. I am not going tor respond to anymore advice or questions. I have just kinda accepted that I fucked up, and am trying to move on, try to forget, and accept any consequences of my actions. My advice for anyone who fucks up like I did is to ignore / not engage regardless of what point you are at - the sooner the better.

I would really appreciate some input. I’m a fairly mentally unwell young human and I’m concerned my therapist’s practice is taking advantage of me.

I’ve been going to a cognitive behavioral therapist weekly for over 4 months now. I do love my therapist and I’ve found the experience really rewarding. But there have definitely been some hiccups.

Firstly, I am fully insured in mental health, but have been paying out of pocket ($160) weekly for these 4 months. (This is rough as I’m a student and service industry worker.) At first it was my understanding I had to reach a deductible of $500 and then my visits would be $50 each (as told by my insurance). 

At this point I’ve paid upwards of $2500 liquid cash to this place in 4 months. This is because of a whole slew of reasons, or so I’ve been told. In the beginning the receptionist would say she couldn’t get ahold of my insurance over the phone (I should note, it is an out of state insurance, but a big name, blue cross). This went on for weeks, each week she would say it would be resolved by the next week, and so on. When I would inquire about it with each visit, she would seem surprised, as if each time were the first I’d brought it up. At this point I just assumed she was bad at her job.

Finally, I bring it up to my therapist. He tells me the reason my insurance hasn’t applied yet is because he’s failed to “log our time” or records or something like that to send to the insurance company. I find this a little shocking since I’ve been there for FOUR MONTHS, but he makes a point of reassuring me, stating whatever extra money I’ve spent will be reimbursed when it’s all figured out.

One other small detail that just kind of puts me off. Things have been going really well, my therapist is often commenting lately on how much I’ve improved. We found a suitable medication for me and I’ve been steadily on it and frankly we don’t have anything left to talk about it seems. I voiced that I felt we could lower our meetings to every two weeks or even once a month, but I felt swayed to come back. And then! The last 2 sessions were literally the SAME session and I don’t think he even noticed.  He even spent the last 15 minutes of our last meeting showing me YouTube videos (admittedly psych related, but not at all related to me.)

I know this is incredibly long but I just don’t know who to ask. Normally I’d ask my therapist about anything but I’m really starting to feel doubts about their character and the character of their practice.

Wife is cheating and in a cult. Need some advice This is a long story. Basically my wife has been having an affair with her boss for the last 4 years and she also slept with another woman about three years ago. Her boss runs an MLM in Tokyo. I am English and she is Japanese. She has left the house and is living with her mother in the meantime while I take care of our 5 year old son. This is where it starts to get weird. The company is like a cult. The people who work there are almost all female and they revere their boss as some kind of God. I gave my wife the option of leaving the comapny and him to be with us but she declined. I am looking to sue them both for infidelity (this is quite common in Japan) but I am extremely worried about his influence on her. She will literally do anything for him. I am worried that she may be looking to flee the country with him. She is still continuing the affair with him and doesn't seem to care whatsoever about the effect this is having on friends and family. I am also worried that if this does go to court then I will lose. He is a very rich and powerful man and I am just a high school teacher. I really need some help with this. Please

Quick edit. I found this on her phone. My translation

“I started working for him in October 2014. I have husband and a kid. He has wife, divorced, 3 kids, not living together, he lives alone. 

The relationship with him started sooner than a month after I started working there and almost everyday. (Not sure “everyday “ but it’s assumed intercourses)
He went to the United States as if he were running away from me. He used to come back to Japan for short times but is spending more time outside of Japan - more than 70% of the time. 

We didn’t have relationship (assuming intercourses) for more than a year. He takes (me?) to Pakistan or other countries, the income raises(not sure who’s), .......he is just repeating that. I don’t feel any his intention for me. 

I don’t even know what he does as a business. It’s all mystery even though I have been working for him for 3 years. There are so many bad rumors about his business and position. 

He may be dating someone else and there is a possibility that he is married in America. 
I don’t want a future with him. 
Because he always finds a new women. He had the same kind of relationship with his former secretary for 9 years. 
He married current wife after
He might be a type of guy who switches women every 5 years or even worse. 

He says that he is dating only me when I ask him if there is another girlfriend.

I'm a pretty silent person and when that happens I am even more silent and I can not even find a word or sentence to say or explain to that person. I feel ashamed, disgusting and guilty for how i make the person feel. I try really hard to ignore the feeling of wanting to disappear and not wanting to talk at all. But i try and do get over myself so I can talk openly with that person but it's really hard for me. On the inside I feel like I want to isolate myself and never look the person in the eyes ever again.

I'm a 23 year old guy from Canada who has been confused about this for weeks now. I don't really know how else to say it but my Mom who is 41 years old has been acting very strange for the past month or two when my dad isn't at home. She's been dressing up in revealing outfits she normally never did and she's walking around the house wearing them when it's just us two at home. My Mom is my best friend and my relationship with her has been nothing short of amazing but now I'm starting to get worried about what's happening because whatever this is isn't ending. Let me give you an example, 4 days ago she was walking around the house wearing full make up and an extremely tiny skirt but just doing regular house work. I have never in my entire life seen my mother's legs on display like that ever. 2 days later she was wearing tight jeans and a very low cut top revealing her chest and her bra. This made it very difficult for me to even talk to her when she was standing in front of me and I ended up going back to my room. I know some of you might think I am over reacting and that there is nothing wrong but like I said she has never dressed like this before especially when it's just us two at home. She is also not going out wearing these clothes but only wearing them around me. On top of that she has also become very touchy. She'll lean on me while watching TV or using her phone and even slap my butt as she's walking passed me. She could just be joking or messing around because she does laugh after doing that but to be honest I don't know at this point. None of this stuff has happened prior to these past 2 months.

Maybe I am thinking too much about this and making it a bigger deal than it actually is but I've waited a while and there are no signs of it stopping. I don't really know how to discuss this problem with anyone else in person so this is where I've come to for help. I'm also an only child so I don't have any siblings that I can go talk to. If you don't have anything nice to say please just ignore this post. Hopefully some people here can help me and give me some real honest advice. Thanks!

UPDATE! #1 (2018-4-10)

So I just wanted to give you guys an update on my problem. Unfortunately it's not a good one at all. My dad is currently at work and only my Mom and I are at home at the moment. While my Mom was upstairs cleaning her room, her phone was ringing. She told me to pick it up for her because she was expecting a call from my Aunt. Anyways, I was too slow to pick it up and when I got in her phone to see who was calling I noticed that her photo gallery was open and I was very much shocked to see what was in it. I found at least 25-30 pictures of me that were all taken at home without me knowing and 2 of them taken when I was changing clothes in my room. I don't even know what to say at this point. I've been sitting in my room and literally doing nothing just thinking about this. Why Me? Like I said in my previous post I love my Mom a lot and she's literally my best friend but today I feel like don't even know her. My entire relationship with her feels like a lie and that everything she did for me was just an act. SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO???? I don't want to run away from home. I don't want to tell my dad and ruin my entire family. I just want everything to be how it was. That's literally all I want. My brain still can't wrap around the fact that I found these pictures in her phone. I literally don't want to believe it. My Mom has no idea that I found this and I put her phone back exactly the way it was on the table. I'm losing my mind and there are hundreds of thoughts coming into my head now. I don't want to lose my mother like this and getting those same feelings for her is something I don't even want to think about. 

Guys if you think I am lying or just trying to live out some weird fantasy I can’t change your mind. For the love of God I am being real. I don’t have any benefit of posting this stupid shit just for my pleasure. I AM LITERALLY IN A MENTAL DUMP RIGHT NOW AND NEED HELP."

my brother was passed out, when i opened my eyes i couldnt see anything, total darkness i thought i became blind, i put my hand on my face and i feel this huuuggee bump (swelling) on my forhead, i hit my head pretty bad and when i could finally see it was so blurry, i look around and i hear my aunt do a really weird sound like snoring i thought she was dying and my niece is screaming the people get my aunt out of the car and i start looking for my phone to call anyone before the people steal it, all of this while i can't see anything it was night it was dark i finally find it.

 I look around and i cant find my brother in the car this is when i totally freaked out i get out of the car and i keep calling his name and i can't find him people lead me to him he got out and sat on the grass i set beside him and he tells me his head and his arm hurt him so much. i'm crying on the grass begging people to call the ambulance they say they called them and he's not replying anymore. I keep talking to him telling him not to sleep. I was so scared he might die .

 Can you believe that at this moment a man comes and he touches my glasses in my hands  to see what it is and then he starts to search in my brothers's pockets pretending to see if he's okay he was trying to find anything to steal and i scream ""get away from him, get away from him"" and he gets away, my aunt wakes up she's fine and walking her husband is just bruised here and there and my niece looked fine to me .the ambulance arrives, and we head to the hospital.

 I had to fight through my pain through the unbelievable headache and not passing out for the sake of my brother's life i was running around the hospital without seeing anything clearly begging for them to do anything but they couldnt the hospital was too samll for anything we had to wait for another ambulance to get us to the other hospital, we moved to another hospital all the while i'm crying sacred that he might die on me while we are waiting and we head in this un prepared ambulance which is a story on its own but anything was fine as long as we could get him there the ambulance stoppes for my aunts husband to throw up which makes us even more late all this time i was in cantact with my mother and my other family members and i tell them where we are heading god the moment we arrived and he's now on my mother and my family's care i broke down even more crying all the time at the hospital.

In the end we all were examined, we are all fine my left half of my face is so swollen and my whole body hurts, my brother has this neck support thing but he's fine but we are all alive, i cant believe that we are all actually alive. Thank god.

I'm still shaking, still crying and words can't describe how scared i am untill now i just can't help it i can't stop it.

My father isn’t fond of White people at all. We’re Black. He says they are the most evil people on the planet. I’m going off to university soon. The university I’m attending has a high White student body. There are no Historically Black colleges in my state. My father tells me, “Be careful around those White people.” My roommate is going to be White. My father tells me to make sure you sleep with one eye open. He doesn’t want me to become best friends with my roommate because he doesn’t want me to have a White best friend. He's highly encouraging me to befriend other Black students at school. He tells me, ""Make sure you make a lot of Black friends. You're a Black man never forget that.""

Everytime I go out with my father, he always talks crap about White people. He says things like “Most of them are racist, they’re crazy, they’re evil, they’re weird, they’re annoying, etc.” He HATES seeing Black and White couples. He always talks crap about interracial relationships. He calls Black people dating White people, “Stupid, sellouts, colorblind, etc.” It’s honestly making me scared to go to university because I’m going to have a White roommate and I’m going to be surrounded by Whites. We live in a majority Black city. I’ve never interacted with White people on a personal level, so I don't know what to expect.

He's making me afraid to go to university.

There’s just so much to say so it’s a little long but there’s a TLDR at the end. I’m leaving so many details out for brevity so please feel free to ask clarifying questions.

You know how when there’s a serial killer or mass shooting the family is always so shocked and blame themselves for not seeing it coming? I see it coming and I’m absolutely terrified. I’m afraid of my brother. We were close as kids since he’s only a year older but once we hit our teens we were never close again. My parents kicked him out of the house at 15 because he was so nasty and violent. He’d physically fight our step dad, punch and berate me, and even put his hands on our sister who was probably like 9 at the time. He went to live with his biological father about half an hour away. 

He didn’t have friends and still doesn’t. He became infatuated with alt-right speakers online for some reason and would just repeat all of their talking points whenever he’d come to visit. This isn’t some kind of political point I’m making, it’s just to emphasize how bizarre it all was. We’re black. Yet all of a sudden black people were plaguing society and black women in particular were “ghetto scum” and “whores”. My family thought it was funny at first, but my sisters and I were horrified. He’d randomly declare that he loathed women and “f*gs” and that rape wasn’t real. He’s not internet savvy at all. Never had any clue how to use social media (I’m talking like 8 followers on instagram that are all bots and only posts really bad, unintentionally deep fried memes) and would basically receive all his information from YouTube. I’d be genuinely shocked if he even knew what 4chan was, but it was like the worst rhetoric from sites like that was being shouted in our living room every other weekend. 

Then the Elliot Rodgers shooting happened. The one with the guy who went on that rant about women beforehand. My brother, the kid raised almost entirely by women who used to play with my dolls with me, was on his side. He was on a mass shooter’s side. I didn’t even know that was a fucking thing.

I stepped back after that. Avoided his visits entirely. All my info after that is pretty much secondhand through sisters or other family members or his nonsensical social medial posts. He still had not even one friend, so my cousin gave him the number of her friend who thought he “had potential”. He was 17 at the time. He’d never had a girl talk to him before so he became obsessed with her immediately. She took too long to text him back once and he blew up her phone with dozens of texts calling her every name under the sun. He left her a voicemail saying he hopes she gets raped or killed. I asked for screenshots and forwarded them to my mom and grandfather, who reprimanded him on the basis of “you’ll never find a girlfriend talking to women like that” instead of “don’t ever talk to another human like that.”

After he graduated he was eventually kicked out of his fathers house for the same reasons my parents kicked him out. He was fired from his first full time job (warehouse) for his behavior and general attitude. At that same job a coworker punched him in the face for reasons unknown to us, but I never once doubted that he deserved it. He ended up joining the military for some reason. My mom was so proud of him and would hear no reason why she shouldn’t get her hopes up. I’m not going to say what he did or what branch is was just in case shit like that is public info, but 3 days into bootcamp he did some dumb, predictably aggressive shit and got kicked out. I don’t know how the military works but he was held there for over a month where he had to undergo a few evaluations and go before a judge. Apparently the judge wanted to make him actually complete bootcamp with no pay as a punishment since he wanted to go home at that point, but the psychiatrist urged him that he was severely mentally unfit. He was sent home and his lived with my parents again ever since. My mom is a mush and is the only one who hasn’t given up on him. The way he treats the only one in his corner breaks my heart. My baby sister told me he tracked her down in the house to tell her that the dinner she’d made, something my mom takes very serious and is always anxious about, was disgusting. He screams at her regularly apparently.

I’m really, really scared. The first thing I thought of was him murdering my family in the middle of the night, and I still can’t get that thought out of my head. I’m in college and have my own apartment so I’m never there. My baby sister is still at home and she’s scared of him. He openly talks about killing himself regularly, and the lack of regard he has for other human life is terrifying. I’ve told my family my concerns and they tell me not to say such things or laugh that he’s not coordinated enough to pull off a shooting. I disagree.

My mom looked into getting him involuntarily committed for suicidal thoughts for awhile, but she gave up on that quickly. I’m not even sure if that would be enough. What am I supposed to do until it’s too late? Sit on my hands? You can’t call the police just because someone gives you a bad feeling. If he’s not going to be a mass shooter he’s going to be a rapist or a serial killer or just something. I’m completely lost on what to do and I just don’t want anyone getting hurt.

TL;DR: my brother is aggressive, violent, and suicidal and i’m certain he’s going to hurt someone someday and don’t know what to do to prevent it."

He’s begging for forgiveness but the whole situation is making me feel sick. I don’t know what to do. Throwaway because this situation makes me so anxious. I’m sorry this is long but I think the detail is necessary. 

Background:
I (21F) have two best guy friends who I’ll call E and R, they’re brothers. I have been friends with both of them for three years now. E and I are closer (or we were before this) but I’ve never thought of R as second best. About a week ago I was out to dinner with the two of them, and we got to talking about relationships. E is in a relationship and has been with the same girl for the last five years. R is recently single as of a few months ago. I told them that I have been single since high school and have never really dated anyone that I’m super into. They both were sympathetic. 

It’s important to note that I am very interested in both of them romantically. When E first started talking to me he was being flirtatious and I thought he was going to ask me out. Only for me to learn later that he has a girlfriend. No big deal, they both have been great friends ever since knowing my feelings, and it’s never gotten in the way of our friendship. They’ve always been flirtatious, though. E more than R, flowers, kisses on the hands, calling me his heart, etc. At first it bothered me, for obvious reasons. Whenever I brought it up to him he said that he did it because I deserve to be loved.  He also seems to have a hard time dividing romantic, friend, and familial love. He’s told strangers that he and R (his older brother) are married. Really strange to outsiders but after a while you get used to it and that’s just how E is. He also does drugs recreationally, the happy stuff like weed and shrooms.  He’s never made an advance on me in a sexual way, or tried to ask me on a romantic date. And never, ever have I felt threatened physically by either of them. In fact we met at a concert when they protected me from a guy who was being a creep. They’ve never been anything but purely kind and gentle towards me in all our years of friendship. 

The actual situation:

After we went to dinner together and I told them about my pitiful dating history, nothing changed. Then a few days ago the crap hit the fan at Friendsgiving. I was at their house with several of our friends. It was relaxed and a great evening until it started getting later. I had noticed throughout the day that R had been getting closer to me than usual. Just little touches that he wouldn’t normally do. I definitely noticed but it didn’t bother me at all. E also noticed, and by the end of the night he was obviously really angry. E and R almost never fight but when they do it’s bad. Like broken fingers and handprints on throats bad. I’ve seen them both solve conflicts with other people in perfectly civil ways, but with each other it’s always a war. 

The evening got later and there were some alcohol and drugs going on, E was high on something, R and I were completely sober. R and I were on a couch together just talking and suddenly he was making eyes like he wanted to kiss me. I let him, like I said I’ve always been interested in him. We were kissing and then suddenly E ripped him off me threw him on the ground and started kicking him relentlessly. It took three of our friends to get him of. Then he turned to me, grabbed my upper arms hard and screamed “your mine” in my face. I was obviously shaken up so one of our mutual friends drove me home immediately after. 

Since then I’ve talked to R and he’s apologized even though he did nothing wrong. I have handprints on my upper arms from E. E has tried to apologize, citing everything from thinking that R was assaulting me, to being confused and thinking that I was his girlfriend. All leading back to the drugs of course. For the record I look nothing like his girlfriend, like full blown racial difference. She wasn’t there at all that evening. E is begging for my forgiveness and swearing that he’ll never be high around me again. He’s extremely upset and wants me to give him a chance to prove that he can still be a good friend. He understands that it could be years before I trust him in the same way again and says that he doesn’t care he just wants to make it right. He has said all of this through text and voicemail which I haven’t responded to yet. 

I’m torn, obviously what he did was horrible and it scared me a lot, but the thought if losing my best friend makes my heart break. I need someone with an outside perspective to shed some light on this. Please help."

One thing lead to another and we started knocking boots on the guest bed. We shut both dogs out in the kitchen. We were by no means trying to be quiet, there are no other houses nearby. Anyways, about an hour later i check my phone amd i have a text from my boss saying that her son would be stopping by to pick up a few things from his room. It was sent 30 mins prior. I checked his room and his suitcase had been taken. How fucked am i? He for sure was in the house and we were being so loud that we didnt hear the garage door. His room was directly across the hall.  What do i do at this point? Should i bring it up and apologize?

Recently I made an Instagram account and I was scrolling through some pages on discover. I found this picture of someone’s thigh gap and looked through the page. This page had 2.7k followers and it was all photos of the person’s thighs/stomach/shoulder. Then I spotted a very distinct jewelry case in one of the background.

It’s making me suicidal, and I’m not sure if I should “tough it out”. I was recently offered a position at a company that manufactures tractor supplies. The starting pay was 14$ an hour (with a boost to 18$ an hour after 90 days), so I immediately accepted the job. 

I’ve never seen that amount of money in my life, and the prospect of earning enough to pay all of my bills (plus rent!) from a single week’s pay sounded exciting to say the least.

After working there for about a week, I’m deep in the throes of suicide ideation. And not in a “Ugh, I wanna kill myself” kind of way, but a genuine mental illness manifesting itself in my head.

Along with the general feeling of catastrophic hopelessness, I’ve been having visual and auditory hallucinations outside of work, which is something I’ve never experienced before. When I close my eyes, I can hear the clanging of the machinery at the plant growing louder, and the noise follows me home. I dread going to sleep because I’ve been waking up to full-blown panic attacks from having nightmares about the harsh sound the forklift makes when it clangs against a piece of metal, which has been a “trigger” of mine all week at the facility. I get really irrationally scared when it happens, and I try to hide it from my coworkers, but I literally start shaking, and they notice. 

My parents were really happy for me that I got this job. I dropped out of college when I was 19 to fuck around with friends, and I ended up working shitty retail jobs to make ends meet for the next five years of my life, so they saw this as a huge victory. Landing this position finally put me in the realm of something a college graduate would make, but it’s a living nightmare and I can’t stand the thought of having to work there even one more day. You have no idea how excited I just got imagining myself not even showing up tomorrow and just leaving it behind for a cozy low-wage retail job instead.

I honestly think this job is going to put me in a mental state that would lead to me committing suicide in the near future. I was unhappy before, but the level of unhappiness I feel in the factory is a type of misery I didn’t even know existed, and every fiber of my being is screaming “*GETOUTGETOUTGETOUT*”

Despite all of this, should I “just keep plugging away” like my family has advised, and comfort myself with the fact that I will be making a lot of money, or do I need to take immediate action and leave for the sake of my health?

**TL;DR** Got employed at a terrible factory job, but don’t know if it would be worth it to push past my suicidal thoughts and anxiety to make a large amount of money which would really benefit me in the future."

And I'm angry....and I feel selfish and horrible about that. So many people are suffering right now, and in my day job I help people. And I work in the medical field. And I'm not able to help, and people I know and love are in danger and fighting for their lives. But...so am I. And I don't know how to deal or if I am the asshole or not for being angry at being alone. So am I the asshole for being so angry? And how do I stop being so damn angry?"

For context, my bf’s younger brother is now my best friend, he used to be my crush, but we ended in becoming best friends and he came out of the closet senior year of highschool, this is his first serious relationship, so far they have been together for 7 months, he is 18 and his bf is 23, the age difference is not what bothers me, but suddenly his behavior changed.

I started noticing that his bf was really controlling, checking his phone, asking constantly where he was, he stopped doing things he likes, for example, in our college there is a small “auditorium” that is outdoors, he used to always go there after classes were over, but stopped because “bf doesn’t like me hanging with strangers”.

More than once he came to me crying because they were fighting, one time I remember that his bf aggressively demanded to see my phone because he wanted to make sure my friend wasn’t deleting texts and he made a scandal that my friend was cheating on him with me because he knew that I had a crush on him in middle school, he didn’t care about the fact that I already have a boyfriend, my friends older brother.

I have been on a toxic relationship myself, the difference being that I broke up with toxic ex after pretty much realizing how much of a pathetic jerk he was, but my friend is still head over heels about his bf, but what has me feeling the most angry is that yesterday, saturday night, my friend was out with his bf, they were going to a party, and I was at home watching movies with my bf aka his older brother, when suddenly my friend called us crying and asking us to pick him up, when we arrived at the place, my friend was sitting on the side walk and when we helped him sit up we realized he had a red mark and a small cut on his cheek, bf was fuming about who had hurt his little brother, but pretty much understood that it was better to get home, my friend cried all the way home, I cleaned his cheek and he fell asleep.

Today, sunday he told us that basically what happened is that bf got hella drunk, ended up kissing a girl and when he confronted him, the bastard slapped him, the worst part, what cut his cheek was a ring that my friend had gifted him, after that he called us, but the saddest part is that the jerk came to their house, obviously my bf threatened to call the police and he left, the only reason why he didn’t beat that bastard up was the fact that my friend was hysterically crying, borderline having a mental breakdown, saying that he still loved that piece of trash and please not to hurt him.

He cried for awhile more, once he calmed down he said that he knew bastard was a bad person but for some reason he couldn’t leave him and that he still had feelings for him, but doesn’t want to suffer anymore, after this, my bf contacted their parents, who are currently in other country and they are flying over here next week, and we are still figuring out ways to help my friend, cause he says he wants to have a serious sit down with trashy bf, but can’t do it alone, We are all seriously scared for my friend, and mad at ourselves because we didn’t stop this sooner.

I’m sorry for the long story but I feel that having the whole context would help with the type of advice, because we know that he is going to need a lot of mental support, firstly to officially break things off

TLDR: my best friend’s toxic boyfriend ended up hitting him, but my friend still has feelings for that piece of shit

Edit: thank you all for your kind advice, proud to say this past Sunday, My friend, my bf and I reunited with that piece of trash of a public mall, and the relationship was finally ended 💜"

I am now in my mid 30s. I recently left a pretty stale relationship and decided I wanted to find someone that I could just be friends with benefits with because I didn't want to really date anyone. A guy on facebook (not my friend) had messaged me and I kind of ignored it for awhile but peeped him out and realized we had a mutual friend, an ex coworker of mine. I didn't add him but we started conversing over messenger. He seemed really cool and I thought it was a promising new friendship.


I invited him over to my house after talking to him for a little over a week. Plan was to watch a movie and chill, then see where it goes. I wasn't opposed to a casual hookup and he knew that. We had discussed drinking also, as I wanted to feel a little relaxed (I'm not a big drinker, 2 drinks tops) but when he got there he seemed kind of anxious and wouldn't drink any alcohol which of course I wasnt going to make a big deal out of, but he was very interested in my drink which had a fruity flavor so he grabbed it and smelled it. I am pretty sure he put something in my drink at that time. I remember asking him about our mutual friend on facebook and it now is clear to me that he didnt really know her at all. He just said he worked with her. I asked where and he said he didnt remember. I dont remember where the conversation went after this. 


In fact, I don't remember much of anything for the majority of the time he was at my house. I don't remember sleeping with him. There is like a huge chunk of time missing. Let me be clear. I had one drink. What I do remember is sitting on the edge of the bed really dizzy while he was asking where my phone was. I asked him why and he just started frantically searching my house for it. I almost fell trying to walk into the living room. I found him there with my phone and he had somehow been able to unlock it. This baffles me because I have a lock on my phone. I still can't wrap my head around that one. I asked him what he was doing and I tried to grab my phone but he pushed me and i fell on the floor, in this process a gun fell on to the floor. I freaked out asking him why he brought a gun to my house.


He grabbed the gun and tossed my phone at me and before running out the door said ""just wait...I'll be back"". When I looked at my phone I found that he had deleted his contact info and all of our messages. When I tried to look him up on social media, I couldnt find him so I am assuming he blocked me. Later the next day I text the mutual friend and she said she didnt really know him that he had just randomly added her one day. I've tried to do some social media stalking on other apps and I think he may have been using a fake name. 


I obviously feel very violated. I know that what happened I guess is technically date rape but I feel like it isnt worth it to pursue anything because I had him come over with the intention of possibly sleeping with him and I know how that looks. I also just dont want to really have to deal with it. I am going to go to the doctor to get std testing (I found a condom wrapper, but you never know). 


I told a few friends about what happened which if I had not been so confused and intoxicated I probably would not have told anyone, but in a panic I called friends to feel safe and validated in the moment. They've all promised not to tell anyone per my request, but they have been really judgmental about my decision to not report. In the moments after he left and for the following couple of hours until I passed out and slept for 14hrs, I was reacting how I think most people would, but now I just feel numb to it and almost dont even care. Which worries me in the long run. 


Sorry for the long post, but just needed to get it all out and would appreciate any thoughts anyone might have about my feelings about what happened. Is it really abnormal to react this way? 

Edit: forgot to mention that he had also deleted and blocked the mutual friend because she couldn't find him when she went to go delete him.

Edit: to the few that responded thoughtfully about my feelings and emotional response to this event, I thank you for your kind words. I think it helps hearing that other people have had similar reactions.
 
To the majority of you that feel it necessary to shame me into reporting, I just want you to know that it had the opposite effect. It completely validated my decision to not report because apparently the world is full of people that think making me feel like shit or blaming me for crimes that may or may not happen in the future is the right thing to do. It's not. And for the comments about wasting your time because I'm not going to take your advice, yes you are wasting your time because my question was not should I report...it was specifically about my emotional response. Why the fuck would I tell anyone about what happened now after so many of you have shamed and blamed me under the guise of advice.

I have no proper interests or aspirations, look at the one other comment I made on this account, and you'll get the picture. I was nearly completely alone in my early teenage years, and, albeit with tears and mental breakdowns, I managed to fight through them.

But recently I've been ""lifted up"" a bit by one of the friends of my late grandfather, who took me along to weekly karaoke, weekend lunches and such. I've been really happy for about half a year because of this, but now I'm back up at the point where being alones hurts again. And I could fight myself through, like I did years ago, and it probably won't hurt as much, but this time I actually \*want\* to survive this without another existential crisis.

If anyone has literally anything to say that could help me, Dear God please say it. I have no clue how people find friends, I dropped out of high school two years ago because the teachers I had took away all my will to study, and I've never worked an honest day since I helped my grandfather harvest grain when I was 7.

A bit of backstory first.

My mother is vindictive. She is what you would call a bitch, and does not understand how her actions effect other people. She has very few friends.

Anyway, when I was six I was diagnosed with a mild form of autism called Asperger’s syndrome. In the last ten years I have grown up and adapted. By the age of 11 I had lost all of the tell tale signs of aspergers and requested my mother stopped telling people I had it. She did for a while (or so I thought) and that was the end of it.

Well now I’m 16 and have just recently joined a new boxing gym and was looking forward to meeting some people who didn’t already know me and making a good impression. Everything went great my first night at the gym although I felt that I was being pandered to a bit and given leeway that some of my peers weren’t. 

I went home and forgot about it until I was checking my mothers texts (with her permission) to see the times and days it was on (she had contacted the coach).

As I’m scrolling through I see the word Aspergers and do a double take, wondering why the fuck that would come up in conversation.
As I read the message I see that she had asked to for a membership discount for a person with a mental illness. She then started going into detail about me having social issues and using boxing as a way of “standing up to bullies” (I don’t get bullied, and I do boxing for fitness and because I took PE Boxing and one of my GCSE subjects) . 

Anyway I was furious and questioned her about it. “They won’t judge you! I was just seeing if I could save some money because of your concession!” She says. I went on to tell her about how I could feel them judging me and that I don’t want to go back there, and told her it wasn’t her secret to tell.

I’m now in my room, typing this. I’m quite angry and upset that she would do this. I just needed somewhere to vent and ask what I should do next.

Sorry for the long post and bad language. Also I’m not that good at telling stories so sorry if it got boring. 

Tl;dr
Mom shared my personal information for her own gain.

My girlfriend and I were having sex with a condom and I finished inside her. When I pulled out, there was some semen dripping out from the end and I started freaking out. She asked what was wrong and I said the condom broke. She replied with just a simple ""oh,"" which confused the hell out of me because she should have been just as worried as me. I accepted it as a rare accident and I suggested we get her the morning-after pill but she didn't want it and said she would be ""fine."" I confronted her about it after dinner and she kind of explained it like shit happens, not a big deal, etc. I explained to her that it was a big deal to me, and I reminded her exactly how much semen was inside her. She seemed more empathetic then but it was clear she didn't care about the incident at all.

I thought about it more and realized that condoms *can* break, but when they do the whole condom is usually destroyed and you can feel it snap. The condom we were using had just the tip open about a millimeter wide but it was enough for all the semen to go into her. What's more is that she laid in bed on her phone for almost an hour instead of cleaning up. I'm really worried she's going to get pregnant, even more worried that I'm not sure if I can trust her, I'm confused right now and not sure what to do.

I'll add that we've been together ~3 months now and she's a wonderful person and I trust her a lot, so I'm not fully set on the conclusion that she did it.

#Update

Talked to her about it, apparently she's doing shitty in her classes, is having issues with her parents, and is having problems with her old roommates/friend group, and she's just in a really low place and ""kind of zoned out,"" and didn't think about what had happened. Basically she was absent-minded from stress. I believe her (but I will still be cautious). Thank you everyone."

She has a good sized chunk of people on there, all asking her about America, etc. There is this one dude from Pakistan that has been talking up this teaching gig, to teach English over there and make 2.5-3k USD a month. No degree required, and they pay for everything. She has no idea who this dude is, who he works for, etc. And comes up to me asking what I thought about moving to China through this. I reply with a stern NO. This shit is so shady, especially seeing as they don't require a degree or even experience??? She is up and down convinced that this is a HUGE opportunity for her to get out there and make a difference. She won't budge and basically says that I'm just a couch potato (I work 5 nights a week on thirds making more than her) and won't take a risk. I offered her an alternative, that if travel she desires, why not travel to all 50 states? It's a huge dream of mine and it would satisfy her wants and needs.

However, I bring up visiting a country for say, a week or two? IT'S A NO GO. Apparently, to buy a passport and all that says we have to stay there close to 2-3 months, which is NUTS. I don't know of any job that would let that fly. I explained to her that I am just exiting a bankruptcy, that I finally have my heels in the ground with a great job and more secure future ahead of me, that to suggest basically living overseas to ""justify"" spending the money to get there? Hell no. She has been saying she loves me and is in love with me, but I don't see how those two click for her, seeing as that's who I am, I'm an introverted planner that takes a while to get going.

I can't really drink almond milk. It gives me diarrhea, which wouldn't be an issue if I didn't already have intestinal problems, but I do. Adding *more* diarrhea is horrible. My vitamin levels are already horrible, but they got worse when I was getting coffee every few days, so I switched to decaf and it didn't help. I thought I was having a flare up or something. I was hospitalized *twice* for cyclical vomiting during this time, making me think I was just getting sicker. Wasting disease was just around the corner. My GP was giving me nutritional weight loss drinks out of her own pocket.

After my second hospitalization, I stopped going to Dunkin just before Thanksgiving,  just because I've been so ill. 

I started feeling a little better, gained two pounds, and finally felt good enough to walk down to Dunkin to get a coffee today.

I get there and order my usual coffee; a small decaf with flavoring *and coconut milk*. I haven't changed my coffee order in nine months. I've **always** ordered a small hot coffee *WITH COCONUT MILK*.

The manager at the counter goes, ""Oh, we don't have coconut milk.""

My response was to ask when they stopped carrying coconut milk, I loved it.

And HER answer to that was, ""oh, we've never carried coconut milk before. It's always been *almond*.""

I called corporate, I called the store. Nobody seems to understand that gravity of this situation. *I was sick enough to be hospitalized*.

Additionally, when several employees told me that they had never carried coconut milk, I had to call someone I had ordered coffee with in the past because I *thought I was disassociating*. I literally thought that I was having a major depressive break and hallucinated the presence of coconut milk. 

I know this might sound like a non-issue, but I spent months being terribly ill because I was pretty much giving myself a laxative. 

What options do I have?

Edit: **Dunkin donuts has contacted me directly and their insurance will be contacting me soon. They're apologetic, and finding me a list of stores that carry coconut milk. All employees at that franchise are going back through food safety training**"

We are both guys.  It’s an embarrassing thing to even ask.  I’m 21 &amp; the guy was 17.  No, we did not have a sexual relationship.  I am not a predator &amp; I’m sure as hell not going to jail over a quick fuck.  

I met him when I was a lot younger through my mom’s best friend.   Eventually, as I got a little older they let me babysit him when they’d go out.  Which I didn’t mind, I literally had no social life or obligations 🤷‍♂️ so I didn’t mind playing video games with a kid, watching TV, whatever.  It kept me company too, ya know?  

Well, we stopped doing that about 3 years ago when his mom felt he was old enough to be home alone.  I admittedly got attached to him.  Not romantically, but like a little brother.  So we’d still hang out &amp; whatnot quite a lot, and he’d always ask me for advice on friends, school, life etc.

I wasn’t aware of his feelings until the end of last year when he’d been drinking.  He confessed everything in a sloppy drunken text.  I was super nice about it &amp; understanding bc we all know how that shit hurts.  Instead he got clingier with me.  He would always question why we can’t be together &amp; didn’t like any of my answers.  

Within the past two months he had gotten really sexual towards me.  Going on about how much he wants to fuck me, sometimes grabbing my ass, trying to kiss me etc. and I’d always yell at him for doing these things.  I never made him feel like it was okay AT ALL.  

Well, one night we’re playing PS4.  Our moms are out at a winery so it’s just us.  It starts by him getting me to look at him &amp; then forcing a kiss on me.   I push him back, and tell him to cut that shit out, or I’m leaving.  So, he gets up and he locks the door.  At this point I just grab my bag off the bed &amp; try to force myself past him but... yeah I really couldn’t.  

The thing is I’ve been on E for the past 10 months.  Nobody knows.  But I am a weak ass bitch.  He’s also a bit taller than me.  And it’s honestly really embarrassing to even admit this to anybody.   But he held me down and forced me to have anal sex with him.  Didn’t even use a condom, or lube.  I bled quite a bit, and he finished inside me.   

He started crying afterwards saying he didn’t mean to, and he won’t ever do it again.  That he never wanted to hurt me.  I was speechless, and stayed quiet.  Then he started saying if I tell anyone he’ll say I was the one who initiated.  And that nobody will believe me because he’s the minor.   

I’m just really lost &amp; I’m hurt because that was my friend ??  My fucking friend man.  I don’t want to see him in jail, he’s a kid.  And I don’t want to go to jail.  Fuck I don’t know what to do."

How do I do... anything? I was diagnosed when I was about 10 or 11. I used to learn things from school pretty normally, like anyone else. Until junior high, when nothing made sense to me anymore. This was about the time that I had my first real music class. It all made so much sense. The music just clicked with me, in a way that algebra never could.

Sadly, this is also the time that the bullying got to the point that I was under constant watch to see if any little thing I did could be used against me. This is when I left my small town school and went to a junior high in the city, taking my broken musicality with me.

I didn't adapt very well. Everything overwhelmed me way too much, and I couldn't handle it. I begged my mom to bring me back to the small town school I used to go to, but she refused, every day. I eventually stopped asking her to enroll me back to what was familiar. Hell, but it was at least familiar.

I didn't understand math at all at this new school. Come to think of it, I never understood math. Not for one single second. And music doesn't count as math, at least not to me. Yes, there's numbers and counting involved, but it's not math.

Anyway, it wasn't until much later, about October of last year, in my junior year of high school, that someone told me that people just naturally understand things when they were kids. Like, actual go out in the world and figure stuff out. That absolutely blew my mind, because I never figured anything out, outside of school. So now my whole synthetic world is crashing down, because life, society, is built upon figuring things out on our own. And school was made to be built upon that, but what good is it when I never had that foundation in the first place?

I tried to look to google to help me with... well, anything, really. I found it pretty hard to find specific things to search, because ""how to do anything"" or ""how to learn"" aren't really good search results in google. Additionally, the only google search results pertaining to autism are about the families of those with autism. Like me just being me is enough to warrant them needing help? Like I certainly don't need help? Oh, your nephew is autistic? We'll do everything we can to help you. Oh, you're autistic and never learned anything naturally and you need help to function as a human being? get fucked.

I have nowhere to turn. I'm normal enough that everyone has a regular expectation of me, but I'm autistic enough that I can't achieve those goals, and I'm left to be the disappointment for the rest of time. The only thing that makes sense to me is music. It feels right. It feels natural. It's the only thing that I could ever have a glimpse of figuring out on my own.

I can't tell you how many nights have been spent with me sitting alone at my laptop, the page remaining white and my face streaked with tears of frustration, all because I can't figure out how to write a damn essay on Lord of the Flies without it being a simple plot synopsis.

I don't learn life lessons, either. I don't know how to learn from a thing I did. I don't know how to change what not to do for the future. Everything I do is a mistake, but I don't know how to critically think about it and find a moral, or what to learn from something. I couldn't even find a moral in the tortoise and the hare until someone flat out told me what it was.

I still don't even know the most basic of basic things about color. Why do two colors match? Nothing about any piece of clothing, besides the facts (red, long sleeves, for example) tells me if it looks good on a certain person or not. I guess my point with this, is that I never had any innate sensibilities. I've heard my fair share of ""oh, nobody does, sweetie"" in my life. And let me tell you, that's a bunch of bullshit. Even if it wasn't bullshit, everyone has at least the capability of figuring things out on their own. I've been so beyond lost that I didn't know what people just automatically knew things or figured them out by themselves until this last October.

I know I sound like an edgy teenager here, but I don't understand relationships at all. Even friendships most of the time. All of my friends are in relationships and that bums me out, so I try to meet girls (or guys idc) and say hi, ask them to coffee (someone had to tell me that's what you're supposed to do). But every single one turns around and never even says hi back. I love to be hugged and held, more than anything, and even my friends (a lot of them are girls, but that's not really important) shy away from hugging me if I say that I need a hug, or even extend my arms for one (Does extending arms mean something more than asking for a hug? someone told me it meant asking for a hug, and idk if it means more than that. Other people do it to their friends with no problems. It might just be me tbh). I don't know how they all got girlfriends or boyfriends, and one of those sounds really nice to me, but they still say that they actually suck 100% of the time and they tell me to not enter one (like it was my choice lol). This is the only thing that I'm skeptical on their word about. If relationships suck, why are they all in one? Why is everyone except me in one? If they suck so badly, then why are they even happening?

Someone, please, tell me what everything is, starting from the most basic principles about anything, especially the things that people just figure out as kids. I'm beyond desperate at this point.

---

***TL;DR: I'm autistic and I've never known a single damn thing about anything that wasn't explicitly taught to me in school or told to me flatly. I don't have an innate sense for anything (besides music), and I know for a fact that I missed out on a huge part of life because I can't figure things out on my own. What the hell do I do from here on out?***"

At first I found out someone had molested my daughter but she wouldn't tell me who so I arranged for her to go to therapy and see a doctor. from her visits she finally told her doctor who it was and because it was abuse of a minor the doctor broke confidentiality and told me I have 3 other children who have now been questioned by me, case workers, and doctors. None of them knew about it or where touched raped or any thing apparently it just was the older two involved. My eldest hasn't lived at home for about a year now so I haven't had to face him. I blocked him on social media and have only spoken to his girlfriend who apparently knew about it before I did tho she thinks I should just forgive since they both where kids.

I don't know how to process this and my brain has shut off. Police social workers and a whole slew of therapy for the kids has been started.

This summer, Harry was taken to a Christian camp with very little signal/WiFi. He manages to send about one text a day.

The problem is the boys in Harry’s dorm are extremely homophobic. They keep hitting him, slapping him to wake him up, shouting gay insults and threats. They have put cream over his duvet and have even broken some of his things because he isn’t straight.

Some of the things they have apparently said to him are:

- “Do you want me to climb in with you, Henry?” (they call him a different name)

- “Do you want me to cuddle you?”

- “Do you want me to do your makeup and kiss you?”

- “Do you miss your mommy, do you want me to sing you a lullaby?”

and the most horrific:

- “Yo, faggot, go to sleep so we can get our knives out.”

""ImaSmokeAlloFYouEarless,Heartless,Careless,and B!+cHa$$,"" and a video of the 10 Most Powerful Sniper Rifles In The World, where he said ""warning to the eyeless, earless, and heartless...""


Should I be concerned, or am I reading too much into it? And what do I even do if there is something to it? I mean, I know I can (and will) just distance myself from him anyway, but it feels like a few red flags are going off in my mind and I don't know what to do about it."

I’m drunk right now and mainly just want to get this off of my chest, but if anyone has advice I would appreciate it greatly. 

I’m 19, in that last three months I quit my low-paying but easy/fun job to move out from my parents house to a different city with my girlfriend that I’ve been with for a little over a year. 

Our relationship is falling apart. We really care about each other and have talked about our problems but recently we don’t even talk to each other we just kinda sit in silence. We’ve had issues with our sex life, living together, how we handle things, etc. I car about her deeply, just we’re on a different page. 

Life sucks so far. I work as a car salesmen, and out of an impulse buy, I bought a car that depends on me succeeding in this high pressure job, that I really hate to continue being able to afford it. 

Did I mention I hate the job? Idk if it’s that I’m lazy or what but, I like being able to clock out when my shift is over (I work 5, 8 hour shifts) usually I have to work 10 or 12 hours. I come home to a relationship that just feels uncomfortable. I don’t feel at home. I love my girlfriend but idk if I’d feel happier alone or with her. 

I am not equipped with skillsets that can earn me more than 1500 a month, which is what I need to afford living ( I live in the US) I don’t know what to do. If I break up with my girlfriend, cost of living goes up. If I quit my job, then l don’t know where I’m going to find a job that pays, as much as I can afford. 

I feel trapped. I feel uneasy. I feel unhappy. I have an empty pit in my stomach, that I’ve been filled with weed and alcohol. I have to help my girlfriend With her anxiety and bi-polar disorder. I’m not going to kill my self, although it’d be nice to not exist for awhile. I know this feeling won’t last forever, but I have zero fucking clue what to do in the meantime. "

And she took the dog's side. Two days ago, my daughter and I were playing on the  living room floor. She was a little farther than arms reach from me. The dog, a 22 lb Sheltie, was about 7 or 8 feet away. I heard a noise and looked up to see the dog charging my daughter. He grabbed her by the face and began to viciously shake her. He wouldn't let go until, I ran over and kicked him. I picked her up and her eye was pouring blood, she had multiple other bite marks all over her face and head. I ran her upstairs where her dad and my mother in law were. When her dad saw what happened, he ran down, picked up the dog and threw him outside. His mother began immediately screaming for HIM to get out of her house for what he did to the dog! We rushed my daughter to the er. By luck, the teeth marks around her eye missed her eye by about a centimeter. She was still injured pretty badly, but I am haunted by how bad it could've been. 
After we got home, his mother told us that it ""wasn't fair to the dog"" for us to stay there. And, the dog doesn't deserve to be reprimanded for what he did to HER granddaughter. I feel I must had that my daughter was NO WHERE near the dog when he attacked. She didn't accidentally pull on his fur so he snapped at her. She wasn't playing near his food dish or with any of his toys. This dog charged her and mauled her completely unprovoked. 
So, the advice I'm asking for... Am I wrong to feel completely betrayed by this woman? Is it wrong to feel like that dog deserves to be put down for mauling my child? Her grandmother has basically told me it was my fault, the baby's fault, and made it clear that she believes its not the dog's fault. So, I need to know... What do I do now? 

EDIT-- I feel should also add, the doctors and nurses at the ER all said that based on the bite marks, you could tell that this was an ""attack"" with ""intent to harm or kill."" 

EDIT-- Also, I do want to say... I am an animal lover. I don't think I even would want the dog put down. I'm more looking for advice on what to do about my mother in law. She has already completely disowned (her words) her son for throwing the dog outside after it happened. And, she's said that she still wants my daughter and I in her life but I just don't know how I could have my daughter around her grandmother who believes its okay that her dog did this.

He took that to mean that he just shouldn't say it in front of me like with other curse words. He got in trouble for saying it at school on two separate occasions. I'm worried every time he goes to the black friends' house that I'm going to get a call from their mom about how he's calling their sons the N word.

Teaching him why it's not okay to talk like a fucking racist is important to me. I want him to understand he shouldn't have the N word as part of his vocabulary at all. Grounding and punishment just makes him avoid saying it in front of adults if he doesn't understand what's wrong with it.

You meet the guy that might be THE ONE and spend a few years together just being young and in love. You don’t have much money but you’re getting by and you’re happy. You have a tiny two bedroom apartment and slowly decorate it together to be not just your apartment but OUR apartment. It feels like everything is falling in to place. You get engaged and start wedding planning. But then it hits you that what you are most excited for isn’t the wedding, it’s the family. You want a baby. 

Every time you pass the little park a few blocks away and see the moms with their children playing, every time you spend time with his sister and her beautiful daughter, and every time you see ANOTHER pregnancy announcement on Facebook.. You wish it was you and your heart breaks just a little more. The realization that you and your fiancé couldn’t afford to start a family is like a little dagger to the heart. You could possibly budget enough to make it work once the child started school and you are both working but there’s just no way it could work during those first few years before preschool. You’d really want to stay at home with the baby to be there for all those precious moments, not to mention daycare is expensive, but you definitely couldn’t make it on one income for a family of 3 in an expensive city. 

Does that ring a bell for any of you? That is where I’m at right now. It’s honestly causing some depression and I have to remind myself that I’m still marrying the man of my dreams next year and I should focus on that. Has anyone else yearned for a child before you were financially ready? What did you do? Did you start a family anyway and struggle to get by or did you wait years for more financial stability feeling like life was missing something. Any advice is appreciated. "

I babysit for a family four days a week. I’m not a neat freak by any stretch but their house is dirty and I’m not sure how to approach it. 

There are flies (house flies and fruit flies) everywhere. Whenever I bump into the kids high chair, a swarm of fruit flies comes out. There are two dogs that get into the trash and are just stinky. One dog is in heat and is leaving small drops of blood wherever she goes. And there are piles of dishes to the point where there are no clean dishes in the cabinets. 

Before I started babysitting, I asked them if they wanted me to do light housework like dishes or a load of laundry. They said no. “We’d rather you focus on the baby. Don’t worry about it.” 

There was one day last week where every dish was dirty again. I ran two loads through the dishwasher and there were still more when I left. They were unhappy because they thought I was doing dishes instead of watching their son. I told them I did it during his nap time but they still seemed annoyed. 

Not only is it kind of gross to work in, the son I watch is two years old and gets into everything. I worry that he’ll pull pots of the counter or he’ll eat some old food and get sick. 

What can I do?"

I know it wasn't a dream or something because the night beforehand, I had fallen asleep with my headphones in, and my phone not plugged in.

I personally don't know what to do. But I am creeped out. I don't know if she's done this before or not. I thought about telling my dad but the last time I told him that she had been rude to me, he flipped out on me. Is there any way I could word it maybe that would get the point across to him? Or should I confront her about it? I'm just so weirded out and I feel like my privacy was invaded.

I was in a strange household until  the age of six when my parents found God.  

When I became depressed around 14 and I told my parents I felt hollow inside, my father told me I was being dramatic and to stop. I began writing poetry about my feelings. My parents found my poetry book, took it from me, and read it. They said it was the devil's work and set it on fire and made sure I watched it go up in flames. After they read my depressing poetry, they began forcing me to wear clothes that weren't dark colored because they said that would fix my depression because dark = devil.

I pleaded with them but was forced to wear all white colors for the next year or so. Until I started huffing paint. When  my parents found me, I had passed out in their garage (I'm 15 at this point) and they decided the devil had gotten into me. So they beat me with belts until I couldn't move. At one point, I had sprinted out of the garage, around the house, and into the front yard where my father caught me and beat me. My mother said a punching bag began moving (we had one hanging in the garage) by itself.  It was the demon that infested me coming out.

I was beaten twice for the same sin. One day I was at my father's auto shop and tried to huff carburetor cleaner. My father caught me, locked the doors to his shop and began spraying me down with carburetor cleaner.  He said if I liked it so much I should die with it. He tried to set me on fire until I broke the door and ran down the road. 

Several hours later my older brother found me about eight miles down the road. I had already stolen and drank several bottles of Smirnoff from the grocery store and decided that's what I'm going to do. He took me home.

Is this abuse? My parents claim they were doing what they thought was right. Now that I have my own daughter, I just can't see myself doing these things.  They claim it was parenting to the best of their  knowledge.  When  I even mention abuse  they bring that out. "

One night I came home after working in a factory for twelve hours doing heavy lifting and general hard labor, and he's sitting out on his porch like ""How was work?"" (we worked at the same factory in different departments) and I tell him I'm beat to hell and really looking forward to getting some sleep. So of course he takes the opportunity to tell me my job is easy and that his job is so much harder. ""I don't even get a break. I have to sit in a chair and watch for flaws in production. Boo hoo hoo, anyway, are you free on monday?""

Bruh my schedule just filled up with excuses not to talk to you, holy fuck

This is the first time a straight guy has tried to ask me out and goddamn, what the hell? (Ladies, I don't envy you, oh my god I'm so sorry) This guy keeps trying to flaunt his money in the few seconds between me getting out of my car and into my house, it's fucking weird. He just bought a new car and tried to tell me about how it's automated down to the stereo and air conditioning blah blah blah, and the other night he made the engine fucking rev while I was getting out of my car and scared the ghost out of my fucking body.

Yo... I don't exactly want to flash my dick at this guy like ""Hey dumbass my name is Henry"" and potentially get stabbed in my front lawn, but goddamn this guy is getting really aggressive. So. (Advice) Does anybody have any strategies you use when a guy won't take a hint? Subtle turn off techniques? Just imagine a crazy ass straight guy that thinks all short people are girls, now imagine you're trying to repel him. What do you do."

Am I a bad person? I've been dating this guy for about 2 months. We met at the library. He just sat down next to me, and we talked for hours. He's a pretty sweet guy but to be honest, I felt like something was wrong. He is very clingy. We havent even had sex which makes it even weirder.
The weekend before last, I learned a few things about him. 
That night he had introduced me to his friends, who weren't really anything like him. They all had their own places, wives etc.. I couldn't help but notice that they kind of treated him like he was this wounded animal. ""You doing okay, buddy?"" ""If you need anything, call me"". I wasn't feeling comfortable. Thats when  two of the wives came up to me and asked if we met in rehab. I said no and one said she ""thought so,  and good for him for finding someone normal and understanding.""  I'm ""so brave for taking him on."" 
I dug for more info and she spilled that after his divorce in 2015, he went on a heroin binge, became homeless, and finally decided to get clean in March of this year after an overdose. He's been living in a halfway house since late March. 
I think it's good for him to be clean, great...but I feel like an asshole for not wanting to date him anymore. I don't feel comfortable with the idea of even sleeping with him. I dont want to be the woman who ""takes on"" an addiction this big. I don't want to date a project. I'm sorry, but that's not my cross to bear. I don't even think its healthy for me to be in this situation. Am I a bad person? "

Not actually for me, I'm writing this post on behalf of my mom who does not have Reddit but could really use some advice!

My parents are in their mid 50's and live alone together. My step-cousin (we'll call him Mike), is in his late 30's and has two daughters (1 and 3 years old). Mike has a wife and is successful at his job and my dad enjoys his company. Overall he is a good guy, but my mom and I also find him to be narcissistic and sometimes, rude...here's why.

He frequently comes over unannounced, typically on Sundays, to hang out with my dad while my mom is doing her own thing (relaxing, cooking, cleaning, etc.). Mike also brings his two daughters and expects my mom to watch them so that he can have a beer and hang out in my dad's garage, which totally interrupts her day. (The fact that he drinks and later drives about 10 miles home with his children is a different, disturbing issue...)

Sometimes him bringing the girls over is fine and my mom doesn't mind watching them, but this is now 4 Sundays in a row that this has happened and my mom would really like to get her Sundays back since she still works a M-F, 9-5 job and feels like she's being used. And also, watching someone's kids for at least a couple of hours once a week is a lot of work! Yesterday Mike came over, dropped off the girls inside without asking my mom to watch them, then later came back in and said, ""Well since you're not doing anything, can you watch them while I go (run some errand)?"" She ended up leaving to go shopping as an excuse and he just sat on the couch until she left, almost as if he was testing her. So now he's basically forcing her out of her own house as well.

Side note: Not really sure what his wife is doing during all of these visits. Possibly enjoying a peaceful day, how nice...

My dad is really not much help and doesn't say anything even though my mom has asked him to so it's also putting a big strain on their relationship and my mom is growing increasingly frustrated. I really want to help but don't know how to handle the situation because I would probably be a jerk or hide lol. What should she do?

TL;DR: My step-cousin brings his kids over to my parents house unannounced every weekend and expects my mom to watch them. How can my mom tell him no?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice everyone! I'm going to talk with my mom after work tonight. It's not easy telling your parents something they might not want to hear but hopefully I can encourage her to speak up and work on her relationship with my dad as well."

I found out that my original poem was published on Instagram, Google &amp; her published book under her name which is hurtful. I deserve my credit for my work. 

The worst part being, her book is available on amazon worldwide.  

I tried reaching out to her on all social media accounts (email,  FB, IG etc) but to no avail. I even wrote a review on her amazon citing concerns over plagiarism but  haven't heard back.

I have my proofs that the poem she posted on IG was published way before she did on her account. I have my proofs &amp; digital proofs of submission &amp; postings g which prove she stole my work.

I need advice on how to peruse thia, get her to retract my work or if that's retraction is not possible, at least give the credits that I deserve.

Any advise is appreciated.

Just asking for some guidance. I'm kinda writing this on a whim here, I don't really know what will come of it so bear with me because I haven't thought this through.

I'm a 17 year old kid living in Canada with my parents and younger sister. I've struggled with thoughts of what you might say is depression but seeing as I've never been diagnosed I'm hesitant to call it that. I should love my life. My family is by no means poor, we live a very average life style and my parents are not in anyway negligent. I go to a good school and I have enough friends to where I shouldn't feel this way. 

It all kinda started in gr 8, and it started on a very positive note. I meet some new people for the first time that I felt I really connected with. They liked video games but not the same ones I did and this allowed me to connect with them really easily. They got me into PC gaming and I really enjoyed it(obviously). I started talking to them on skype everyday and it was really a great time in my life. I'm not a very sociable person so to find people I liked and who liked me was a real anomaly in my situation so I jumped at the chance. We had a blast for that year, and even into the next when we all went to the same high school for grade 9.
It all kinda started going down hill about half way through my sophomore year. I lost some of the friends I had made from middle school and made new ones who had the same interests as them. We would do basically the same thing as we always did but for some reason it wasn't working like it used to. I would play with them for hours, laugh, chat and have fun, but when I got off I would always have this sinking feeling. I dismissed it as just wanting to keep playing with them and went on with my year. I soon realized that it wasn't that at all. Even when playing I would have hours of fun and laughter as always but then, like a light, mid game or mid whatever we were doing, it would completely knock the wind right out of my sails. 
It was junior year at this point and I began playing a game called Overwatch competitively. I played it nonstop for the year and after thousands of hours of practice and hard work, managed to make it to top 500 in North America. After reaching this goal I thought I would feel relived (seeing as all my hard work had paid off), but i wasn't. I started using the game as an outlet for all of the shit that I was struggling with internally. I became very negative, and even the game wasn't satisfying me anymore. I thought that maybe if I reached top 500 I would feel like I was worth a damn but it was the opposite. I said very nasty things to people in my games all the time and taking all of my inner-turmoil and concentrating it as anger and frustration toward others. I started resenting myself and the game so when the summer before senior year came around I decided I needed to stop. I uninstalled the game and tried my best to start going out and talking to people in person(people being my close friends). Once I started doing this I realized who I was surrounding myself with. Because of my awful social anxiety I had subconsciously surrounded myself with people who didn't talk about anything personal, *anything*. They would always deflect with a joke or a quip and I started taking notice. I had blamed these terrible, terrible feeling of loneliness and, dare I say, depression on things like games other outlets for so long I hadn't thought that maybe I was the problem. Keep in mind that these feelings had been stewing and growing inside me for years now and I still hadn't told anyone but how could I? I hate asking for help so sharing anything personal with anyone goes against everything within my being. On top of this, because I had quit Overwatch, my biggest distraction and outlet for all of this, whenever I was alone, I was plagued with a sea of hurtful and negative voices crushing me with every word. I couldn't stand it so I set my sights on trying to make myself better. I tried everything in the book. I read and learned about all kinds of mental health issues and how to over come them, but nothing stuck. After spending the final month of my summer on this I was completely out of ideas. The feeling of worthlessness and self loathing had more then doubled and school was starting up so I did what everyone does, I started talking to an old friend from elementary school who went to my highschool and started doing hella drugs. I wasn't an addict or anything but they offered a GREAT escape from what was going on in my head. I knew it wasn't a long term solution but I didn't care anymore, all I wanted was for this feeling to go away. I wasn't an avid user at all, I would just go out with friends and smoke. Still depressed and demoralized the school year started and I was back in the fray, but this time with no safety net. I found a new group of friends which was a major thing for me. I was able to talk to new people and hearing what they had to say was amazing. I thought I was improving. After a few weeks of developing new friends, I had a week to myself. Everyone was swamped with work so no one could hang out and I was alone again with my, oh so wonderful, thoughts. However I thought that with all of the new friends I had made I would be okay, feeling accomplished for taking a step out of my comfort zone. 
Boy was I wrong. 
It was the same as before. All of the feelings came back but stronger than ever. I didn't know what to do. I had thought that maybe if I had made so much progress with myself that those feelings would at least die down or go away altogether. And yet there I was, thrust back into the abyss.
I realized at this point that maybe there was something else going on here. After a full night of thinking I decided to talk to my Dad about it for the first time (this was a week ago). I told him everything (kinda). How I felt like dirt, how whenever I was alone I was suffering and sad. It was a shock to him, but he told me about all of his mental health issues. He suffers from severe anxiety and this caused him to go into serious depression later in life. He told me about his psychiatrist and how he has a therapist and everything. I thought this would make me feel a little better but it really didn't. 

He offered to take me but I said no. 


I'm terrified. I had pondered the idea that I might have a mental health problem before but I never gave it any real deliberation. The idea that something might actually be wrong with me in a way that I can't fully control is so so scary to me. 
I don't want to label myself and have to live the rest of my life with it hanging over my head. I know its irrational but I'm stumped(to say the least). I don't know what my friends will think of me and I don't want anyone to treat me like damaged goods. Even my dad has been dancing around me like I'm a time bomb. I have been sitting on this for a while, maybe for to long and this is kind of my last shout. I don't know where to go from here and I terrified at what the rest of the year holds if I don't sort this out.

I'm sorry this was so long but even in this I've still left so much out. I'm really really bad at sharing my emotions and experiences with anyone, even in this anonymous text post I know I haven't shared everything that has gone through my head(you know old faithful, suicide :) ). I'm just looking for some guidance on where to go from here.

Thanks for reading and sorry for any errors I don't think I can read this over again because even though i may seem mundane, having lived through all of this, every sentence feels like a kick in the chest"

This girl and her posse has been bullying me at work sense I started... I haven't done anything too her or them either, I'm just really shy and socially awkward...

They'd do things like bother me when I'm trying to work slowing me down, then pulling me back to their aisle to help them finish despite me not being done. Poke me in the chest often, try to get other guys too touch on me and flirt with me, like one day she literally grabbed my leg and her guy friend came and pretended to dry hump me... They just laughed like it was funny... and I had an awkward smile on my face.

She would also ask me for my lunch or things I buy, took my jacket when it was winter, and took and went through my phone. The worse thing she had done before is push me against the wall in the bathroom and take my money and phone from them but she gave them back saying she was kidding...

----------------

So after all of that, I did actually tell on her which got her a strike but she didn't get fired they just said they have to watch her and to not be around her.

So I guess she heard and they talked to her about it which actually pissed her off. So the next day, I notice she doesn't say anything to me but her and her friends are staring at me a lot. I'm just kind of shy and try to pretend like I don't notice. Eventually a bit after lunch, I go to the bathroom and I hear a lot of people come in, I didn't exactly know who it was, I finished peeing but I'm the type of shy person to wait till everyone leaves.

But no, it was the girl and her posse, she kept pushing on the stall door and finally opened it as I was trying to pull up my pants but she grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out. Then two other girls grabbed by arms and they took my shoes, my pants, and panties. I started screaming and yelling for help and another girl kind of punched me hard in the stomach telling me to shut up... so I did...

After that they all pulled out their phones and started taking pictures, I tried to run out but so many where blocking the door they just held me down and took my shirt and then my bra making me completely naked. I couldn't run, hide, or do anything... every spot was cornered and they were still taking pictures... so I just curled up in a corner and burst into tears... crying like I was a little child.

I thought it was over but no, she grabbed me saying, ""no no no bitch, you wanted to leave a second ago so go, get the fuck out, get out the bathroom"" dragging and pulling my arms. They then pulled me off the floor and pushed me out the bathroom door where customers... people checking out... people walking by... other employees... kids... all saw me naked... I felt a sharp pain in my chest and couldn't speak anymore. I tried to run back in but hit the wall... I get up and try again by this time the girl and all her posse was walking out at the same time blocking my way as if they didn't see me and I was literally just naked trying to force my way back in. I even ran in the guys bathroom just to get out of there and there was 2 guys in there washing their hands that looked at me... I ran back out and too the girl's bathroom finally... I found my clothes in a shitty stall... literally.

I couldn't anymore... I was in tears, I had a horrible headache, my chest was hurting, I just put them on anyway, they smelt horrible, they were wet, it had... stuff on it... but I just ran as hard as I could till I was out of the store, then I just ran and ran till finally I was home. My parents were gone so I just fell to my hands and knees and started screaming on the ground like a psychopath and basically mentally broke...

The next day I called over phone and quit and hung up asap. I haven't left my room since this happened and I feel like if I sleep I'll relieve it all... anyone please help... I just need to talk to someone."

I am more interested in my self than others (that's not to say I don't find people interesting, it just has to be a subject I like for it to not feel like I'm pretending to be interested).

Everything I do feels fake. When I help people at work I always ask myself ""What's the right amount of help? Doing X much will make me look like a pushover and doing Y much will make me look like an asshole.""

When I once bought a gift for a friend and he said he was sorry he didn't get me anything yet and I said, ""It's fine. I *wanted* to get you this."" but deep inside I was just doing it to look like a good friend. I also feel just as fake when I say ""Thank you"" or when I greet others etc.

I do things with my family for the sole reason that I know that I'll regret it if I don't. But at the present of doing it I sometimes feel like I'd rather be with friends expunging my ego.

Long story short; my best friends boyfriend had sex with me whilst I was unconscious at a New Years party (I know this from a visit to a rape crisis centre, the fact my pants were off and that I'd bled everywhere). He has also had one other rape accusation against him and a sexual assault accusation prior to this that I found out about a couple of weeks after the incident, and my best friend knows about these two.

I was extremely upset and had to deal with occasionally seeing him whilst they were together up until a week ago where I was forced to tell her (long story). Prior to this, I didn't want to as I didn't want to ruin our friendship as she was like my sister. She was very upset and basically confessed that she wasn't happy with him anyway as he treats her really badly and manipulates her, which all of our friends had noticed.

She confronted him about everything and he basically admitted to it all, obviously didn't refer to it as 'rape' but tried to claim it was consensual despite the fact everyone at the party recalled me being carried up the stairs by my friends and put to bed by them passed out. Apparently they had broken up. 

Anyway, since then me and her have been fine mostly but I noticed that he was still her phone background, then today he rang her twice, but she didn't answer. I asked her about it lightly and said 'is he still trying to get back with you' and she went extremely red and said 'I don't know, it's weird, like he is acknowledging that he was in the wrong and stuff' and then an awkward silence followed.

However, I've suspected for a couple of days that they've still been in contact and I'm honestly devastated. The fact she believes that him 'acknowledging being in the wrong' even comes close to making it acceptable for her to be civil with him or even still be seeing him makes me sick. It was my life he had completely turned upside down, not hers. I don't see how she can believe that anything he says could even begin to make him deserve forgiveness. It isn't like he just cheated on her, he is a rapist and a downright evil person, I don't see any room for apology.

Should I cut her out of my life?
Am I overreacting?

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll start out by saying that I am well versed on the necessities of adequate protection during the Battle of Balls Deep. The affliction I'm about to describe, however, would probably not be unheard of in a teenage boy's long list of excuses to try and avoid having to armour his purple-headed soldier - along with ""it's your job!"" and ""it doesn't feel natural!"".

I was partaking in some gland-to-gland combat the other day with a (correctly affixed) cock-cloak securely enveloping my meat-seeking missile. After a 15 to 20 minute game of hide-the-bratwürst, I was ready to unleash my torrent of population porridge. I ensured my penetration partner had no unfinished business to attend to, and proceeded to release my gentleman's relish into the safe confines of the custard enclosure. 

But alas! To our great surprise, my penis colada filled the rubber ghost to the brim - the tip and sides of the fiveskin baby-stopper were completely inflated with the inhuman amount of clam sauce I had just produced, and within seconds it began to leak out the bottom, dribbling all over both members of the cunting party. Fortunately she was on the pill, but sadly the pill protects against neither embarrasment nor digust. 

It came as a shock to me, as it was a while since I had last equipped a cocksnood whilst spelunking in the Bat Cave - previous partners had been otherwise protected, and were happy to forgo these sanctions in favour of a fresh injection of liquidity straight into the economy. 

I discovered at a young age that I had the useless superpower of producing unholy amounts of Pearl Jam - I'd go so far as to say that my white volcano eruptions would even rival Ron Jeremy's - and this will undoubtedly cause problems for me now that I'm living the life of a lone ranger. 

I scoured the internet, desperately hoping to find some other poor souls who suffered from the same affliction as me, but alas - I was met only with rebukes such as ""no, that's impossible, rubber gunnysacks are designed NOT to do that, you must be using it wrong!"" or ""try using a bigger/smaller one!"". To these statements I reply, NO, I am not using it wrong - and the very average proportions of my standard-issue pump action yoghurt cannon assure me that size is not the issue.

So my questions to you, good people of reddit: Does anyone else suffer from this predicament? What might I do about it? And why does my Spurt Reynolds release enough white-out to erase the entirety of Bill Cosby's record of abuse allegations?

Now this might not seem so bad but I have a history with this girl. 

I had known this girl liked me for awhile but I didn’t have the same feelings back. So when she finally decided to tell me that she liked me, I as kindly as possible said that I just didn’t feel the same way. She made some public posts on Instagram and Snapchat saying the her crush (me) let her down as nicely as possible, so naturally I felt good about myself, “Hey I didn’t make her feel like garbage!” Which is honestly an accomplishment for me.

Now it was at this point I thought my story with this girl was over, but it was just beginning.

About two or three days ago (maybe four now that I’m writing this at 1 am) I was informed by a friend that they had found this girls fanfic account, now this doesn’t sound all that bad but she did have some pretty sexual stuff (we’re talking detailed) but none that had involved me. Then I found it, for the sake of reddit, I will call it just “The Story”. 

“The Story” stars me and the girl as a couple and we hang out just as couples do, but it is a day by day documentary of a fantasy life that she is living with me. 

She includes the real first names of many of my friends and other people at school, this isn’t my biggest concern but she also uses the real titles and last names of teachers and deans at our school. I’m not exactly sure if she ever says the full name of our school but she practically does with the name she switched it out for. 

Many of the events in “The Story” are fictional, but several were true but adapted. Every year we have a girl ask guys dance and there is a football game that accompanies it, at this game the band plays meaning I’m there as I am in the band. In this part (oh yeah did I forget to mention it’s over 90 parts) she mentions the band directors name, our teams mascot, several band members names, and me and her kissing plenty of times, and VERY passionately almost ALL of the time. She includes details about me and other people that are not necessarily dangerous or telling but just strange and awkward feeling. She mentions that I was standing in a circle of friends and that she was standing there too, I go on to say instead of going to the dance, that I would be going to a concert. This ACTUALLY happened except she wasn’t in the conversation, I never directly told her I was going to a concert meaning she must have just listened in on something I said at that football game and ran with it. This is just one small example of these slightly altered events.

For the sake of time, I’m going to skip everything that is just me and her kissing and cuddling and me meeting her family and me calling her babe and me being involved in every part of her life. Let’s just get to this... 

In one part, I come over when no one is home and we cuddle which turns into us kissing then we start taking our clothes off. Long story short, we have sex in high detail and when I “finish” she, “passionately kisses me so I can taste myself” talk about something that is really f***ing awkward to read. No where else, as far as I know, does “The Story” get more sexual, but there are plenty of situations with slightly less detailed but still concerning things.

This entire thing makes me very uncomfortable and several of my friends feel the same way, I’m not sure there is anything I can do but possibly confront her about it. Having someone else describe their sexual fantasies with me in them is NOT okay in my mind and the use of real names, places, and events doesn’t make it any better. 

I hope this was the right place to post this, if anyone has any advice on how to deal with or confront this situation please let me know, thank you!"

Now the community that I worked so hard to build and nurture has become a place where no one can express any negative thoughts about practically any CBD products, especially the ones on the sidebar. Having emailed Reddit's chain of command as we as the admins and upon receiving no response I now turn to this sub in hopes I may find some answers. 

I'm really open to any ideas, I've long given up on ever getting back the top mod spot, but I'll be damned if I don't fight to make that community a reflection of what I believe CBD is: a wonderful medicine that may be the only source of healing available right now for many different ailments.

At one point I invited him over to my house so he could meet my parents. Everyone was polite and friendly it seemed. We weren't allowed to go upstairs, but we were given some privacy in the living room. When he left, my mother looked at me and said ""You're too young."" We had a brief conversation and she basically said I was too young to date. This confused and irritated me because 1. She's expressed her approval of me starting to date and having boyfriends in the past. and 2. I'm 16, which is young, but also a pretty typical age to start exploring romance. It's clear that my parents disapprove of him, but I don't know why. He's polite, ambitious, academically inclined, etc. Anyone have any clue what's going on? What can I do to make my parents more comfortable with this guy?

Edit: For all the people wondering, he's 1.5 years older than me. He was 17 when we started dating, recently had his 18th birthday."

She could have weeks, months, or years even though doctors don't believe she will last that long. I feel an immense anger at the world, science, God, and myself for not being able to help. Along with the anger I feel hurt. I hurt knowing that she'll never see me get married, meet her grandchildren, or see me finally make something of myself.

I (20 mtf) have been away from my mother (43 f) for all of my life and just got into contact with her a few months ago and we've had a great relationship until recently, I got a call yesterday to come over and watch my little brother (13 m). She will not leave him home alone I thought this was strange but didn't think anything of it until he went to the bathroom. After about a half hour I hear him banging on the wall I thought he fell or hit something so I asked through the door if he was alright he said yes I went to go sit back on the couch and he opened the door standing with his pants and underwear down around his ankles and said ""Well arn't you going to help me."" I didn't think that it would be appropriate for me to wipe a 13 year old so i told him ""No you can do that yourself."" He got angry and screamed and started slamming the bathroom door over and over again while screaming for me to come wipe him. I sat in the front room because under no circumstances am I wiping a 13 year old's butt. I then got a call from my mother asking why I was being mean to her baby. I said I'm not wiping him and that's that. She started to talk about how i needed to do it because he doesn't know how. I told her that he's 13 years old and then she needs to teach him. This might of been a little harsh I don't know but she came back from the store early and began screaming at me for making her come home and for not helping my brother I walked out of the house in the middle of her yelling and went home. She's called me and asked to speak about what happened I haven't responded. I feel like I still like her and I do want a relationship with the family but I don't know about any of this. I'm sorry if this is too strange or doesn't make sense I'll try to  answer any questions that any of you have.

TLDR: Mother still wipes her 13 year old's ass he expected me to do it when I was watching him and when I didn't my mother came home and screamed at me and now wants to ""talk about what happened""."

He was in perfect health and my only family. We lived together. I have no other immediate family and no friends. What now? I'm 28 with a fairly low paying job ($100 in the bank and no savings right now) and I moved in with my Dad three years ago because he divorced my mother, his wife of 30 years.  I am a private investigator and caught her in an eleven year affair, which lead to the divorce.

My father was due to retire in two months from a lifelong career working for the Air Force (first joined as enlisted, fought in Vietnam, went to college, joined an an officer, was honorably discharged, and then worked as a civilian for the DOD for the rest of his life).  He was the most selfless and kindhearted person I've ever met and the thought of being 10% of the person he was almost seems like an impossibility.

He was driving to work this morning, hit some ice (because the county we live in has two working snow plows), and apparently had a heart attack.  Somebody found him much later.  I was woken up this morning by the coroner knocking on my door to break this to me.

Last night I said goodnight and we talked about how we were planning on going to the shooting range this weekend.  Today he's gone.  I can't even fathom how this is possible; he was seemingly in peak health, didn't smoke, didn't drink, ate right, exercised, all of it.  And there's a heart attack as he drives two blocks up the street.  The place he died is literally two blocks from the house.  He turned 67 last month.

I've called the funeral home, which has his body, and I need to see them tomorrow.  I've called his three family members on the other end of the country, who are flying out tonight and tomorrow.  I've retrieved his pickup from the place that towed it after he died (and charged me $150 for the 'service').  I've performed a password recovery on his email but since he regularly deletes his email there's nothing useful.

I am trying to find the attorney he filed his will with, which I am supposedly the sole beneficiary.  I've dug through thousands of documents today and see statements for bank accounts and credit cards and all kinds of things I have no idea where to begin with.  I see the power bill sitting on the counter and see it's due in a few days.  The personnel manager at the base called me to offer her condolences and let me know that they'd be in touch regarding benefits or something.  I know I need to contact a probate attorney too and reached out to a lawyer friend to give me a referral.

And I'm sad.  I am so sad.  He was my best friend.

From my earliest memory he was there for me, always encouraging me to push myself to my limits and be a good person.  Everything he did was for me.

Some of the the Christmas presents I got him are still in the living room.  We saw Rogue One together on Christmas and he was so excited for the next one.  And now he'll never get to see it.

I have literally nobody in my immediate life.  I am alone.  My girlfriend had to move to California for a job and we've been long distance.  His three siblings are flying out right now but live on the east coast and I'm in Idaho.

I am also the first to admit that I have zero friends.  I don't use Facebook or Twitter, have virtually nobody that I spend time with outside of work.  Prior to today my contact list in my phone (a flip phone at that) was my girlfriend, my dad, and my boss.  That's it.  Now it's tripled with all the people I've had to update on the horrible, horrible news.

He was the only piece of stability I had in my life.  I loved my dad with all my heart and I've fought with some pretty major depression for most of my life - especially in the years since I discovered my mother's affair.  He was always there for me, through anything, as I tried to be for him.  I am not processing this well.

So I guess my questions:

* How should I find his will?  I've found a lot of other documentation but not the will.  I know he has one (he specifically got it updated after the incident with my mother) but I can't find the attorney.  I have found his divorce attorney's paperwork but they aren't picking up.

* What do I need to do next?  Contact the probate attorney?  How will I pay for that?

* How do I determine his debts and assets?  I know his vehicle was paid off but he ended up going into debt paying off the thousands of dollars in BoTox my mother racked up before she left him.

* How do I determine exactly what bills he had been paying?  Power, cable, what?  I've only rented once before briefly and am totally lost.

* How can I deal with this crushing pain in my soul?  I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and recognize the stages of grief, but being IN them is another matter.

Thank you all.

Sincerely,
Dylan

**Edit 1:**  I promised you all I'd respond today but I am sorry to say I will have to put it off another day.  I had to spend my day with family, fighting to stay composed and making decisions at the funeral home, writing my father's obituary, trying to contact the attorney who might have his will who is MIA, and preparing for a service on Monday.  Last Monday Dad and I were talking about politics and Star Wars and what to have for dinner.  It's all so surreal and feels like a sick, terrible joke.

All of these thoughts were so painful.  We used to play golf and tennis all the time and were planning on doing it again.  He used to yell at the Minnesota Vikings every time football was on and I'd help him find the right streams.  I'll never hear that yelling again.  I'll never taste his cooking again.  All his family flew out and were helping out all day and I was expecting him to walk out of the other room the whole time, because he rarely got to see them all in the same room and I can't even imagine that picture without him.  I wish it was me and not him.  I honestly thought that I would go before him.

I was not ready for this gaping wound in my soul.  I have kept it together for the sake of family, for someone taking charge during the faux-sympathetic funeral home meeting with a money-grubbing casket merchant.  I have kept my tears to myself and pretended to laugh along with the family as we reminisced, while inside I see so much as a certain coffee cup or a DVD he never got to watch or one of the many gifts he bought for me throughout my life and I feel like taking an industrial drill to my forehead.

Please know that I have read all your very kind and considerate responses and will respond as soon as I am able.  Right now I am going to get ready for bed.  Thank you all for your kindness, consideration, and sage advice."

To make a long story short, I have a brother in high school whose grades aren't looking too good (B's, C's, one or two D's). Our parents don't understand how he's like this now since he used to be a straight-A student back in Elementary/ Middle school. I, being the older sibling, understand the struggle of trying to get great grades, especially in high school.

I will admit though, he's doing worse than I did at that age. He spends a lot of time playing video games, on his laptop, talking to friends etc. I did the same things but for some reason, he's performing worse than I did. Regardless though, he hid his report card and my parents found out. They're talking about punishing him, taking his door away, taking his games etc. etc. but **I just feel as if there's a way around all of that. A way to facilitate things and have him do better without all of the harsh punishment, yelling, arguing etc.**

I told my mom what if she and my dad try doing things like checking his grades online (weekly, so they won't be surprised when/if he brings a bad report card home), have him do his homework at the table, look over/study the work for the classes he's struggling with (2-3 times a week), and so on rather than resort to punishment.

At first, my mom shot that idea down but she then came back to me and asked for me to put together a list of things they could consider doing in order to help him, rather than doing the typical ""Yell at you, take away your stuff, see you're doing better, give your stuff back"" pattern that they always follow.

**I can't think of more possible solutions, so I wanted to know if any of you had ideas? Thank you.**

**EDIT: Thank you all for replying!** I'm still in the midst of responding to everyone. I should have clarified this though: The reason that they want to take this door away is that we all know that he stays up at night and plays video games while everyone else is asleep + while his door is closed. I can see how they think taking the door away might solve things, but I just think that there are other alternatives."

Some background: I have been a cam girl for six years now and have supported myself through that exclusively. Clients who want to be submissive are fairly run-of-the-mill, and even the ones who want to be financially dominated (eg. blackmail roleplay or simply demanding money from them) are pretty common and appear not to spend more money than most other clients. Most of them clearly have day jobs, their own limits on how much they are willing to spend or willing to do, and generally seem to think of cam sites as a fun extracurricular activity. Even the ones who use cam sites in what I personally might think is an unhealthy manner tend to only stay on the site or on one single cam girl for a few months at most.

Then there's the client I am concerned about. I'll call him Frank. He started out seemingly like any other sub who wanted to be dominated. He enjoyed being humiliated and it seemed that he also enjoyed me demanding money from him, so that's what I did. He has been my customer for 3 or 4 years now. In the past year he has become far more interested in more frequent communication (sending Emails through the site's inbox service) and sending longer messages. He has also been on the site almost any time that he is not at work.

He is in his late thirties, and while I'm not qualified to make a statement on what level he is writing at, it clearly is not what it should be. He doesn't seem to know how to spell, there are run-on sentences and no apparent structure or flow to anything he writes. It is all very disorganized. I am not a professional but if I had to guess, from some of the stuff he says, I think he might be mentally impaired, or at the very least perhaps he has a low IQ. He has also talked about being depressed, having contemplated suicide in the past (he said that he does not feel he is at risk of doing it in the near or foreseeable future though,) and he has trouble maintaining friendships and work relationships. He is often impulsive (he wouldn't disagree with that statement,) but doesn't seem to see what is wrong with that, he is a dangerous driver by his own account. He also says that his license is currently suspended but he drives anyway. He said he used to be an alcoholic but he doesn't drink any more. He gets frustrated with and mouthy to his bosses (he works in a kitchen and appears to change jobs very frequently.) Overall, he seems like he might have some sort of cognitive disability and have issues with impulse control. He also seems not to realize this or understand why exactly these things cause him problems. He has also said that he is not close with his family, although he has a few friends that he sees on occasion. He has also been in trouble with HR and his boss time and time again.

To be clear: Money is not the issue here, at least on my end. If he stopped logging on tomorrow I'd still be fine financially so it's not so much a question of ""This feels wrong but I need the money"" as much as it is ""I'm not sure if this is wrong but either way I don't know the best course of action at this point.""

He told me about a year ago that he stopped enjoying financial domination as much and he would prefer to be dominated in other ways, so I stopped with the financial domination. He keeps sending very large tips though, and I'm not sure how I feel about accepting money from someone who has such trouble taking care of themselves, works in a kitchen so probably doesn't earn very much, is impulsive, and might be mentally challenged. I know this sounds ridiculous but even though this had been on my mind for a while, what prompted me to write this post was that I had started reading *Flowers for Algernon* and the ""Progress Reports"" written by the protagonist in the beginning of the book reminded me so much of Frank's letters that it really got to me.

Up until now I have tried to make lemons out of lemonade here. I have made a habit of ""dominating"" him in ways that I think would help him, like commanding him to adjust his diet in healthier ways, set aside money for himself, patch things up with coworkers, keep a journal, exercise lightly, and hopefully I'll think of more. He knows that is exactly what I am doing, so it isn't like I'm pulling one over on him or anything.

Should I completely cut off contact with this person? Should I talk to him and tell him maybe he should be working on himself rather than spending money on cam girls? Clearly his cam site use is unhealthy, but it seems like everything else in his life is as well, and it is not obvious to me that quitting camming would fix any of it, or even that he has the capacity and the support system to improve his own life. To add to that, he is in his late thirties and supporting himself. Even if his life isn't what it could be, he *is* a grown man taking care of himself and on some level it seems like I don't have a place to tell him otherwise (beyond what he is okay with and specifically asks for, obviously.)

Thoughts? Suggestions? How should one navigate this?

**Edit/Update: Was not expecting this to blow up so big. Thanks for all the comments, everybody. To clarify: I am never ""off the clock"" talking to this person. The relationship is strictly professional in the sense that we only chat on this one web site alone, and it is not unusual for clients on cam sites to want to talk to the cam girls about their personal issues. I'm guessing the reason for that is that it is less expensive and also less clinical-feeling than seeing a therapist, even though most cam girls are obviously not qualified to give the sort of help a therapist would. I think for many it serves a similar function to when someone wants to vent on Reddit about their personal life. They'd rather not talk to people they know about whatever is bothering them, so a cam girl seems like a good option. Singling this one person out as someone not allowed to do that doesn't seem entirely fair to me. After reading all of your comments, I have decided that the best thing for me to do is to continue encouraging this person to work on himself and to prompt him to improve his life in other ways so that he'll be better equipped to take care of himself and enjoy life when I eventually stop camming, and ideally sooner than that. As a grown man taking care of himself who might not necessarily have all his shit together, he of course knows he can stop at any point, and I've made clear to him many times that he is still welcome to chill in my free chat even if he never spends another dime. That is probably a fairly anti-climactic ending, so sorry about that, but to see all of you guys caring so much about this is really heartwarming. It's nice to see so many good people. :-D**"

I really need some advice. I think I am struggling with depression, I literally feel useless and unfulfilled and I don't know what to do.

 I don't know if this has anything to do with it- but I am also gay, so especially its sometimes hard to teach some of the doctrines from the church. I really don't want to tell anyone in the mission about that yikes

Honestly this post is really poorly written but I am looking for some things to not be so depressed while spreading the gospel and stuff

Also I can't go into too much detail because I really really want to stay anonymous

Thanks to all


Edit:

Wow! Thanks for all the comments- 
I do want to say that I believe in the gospel truly, the book of mormon has helped my life personally before and I do believe it is the word of God.

I also want to say that I am quite scared of telling my mission President. I won't describe his background because it would be a self dox but let's just say that one of my previous companions asked him about a gay person we were teaching and he basically said he needed more faith.

It honestly was some of the hardest moments of my mission so far to be teaching someone who was gay that in order to be in good standing- they were forbidden from having romantic relations with someone of the same sex.

I don't want this to become an anti mormon chamber and I dont really want to make this ""The Gay who was saved by /exmormon!"" 

I'm simply looking for ways for me to stop being so focused on things like this and focus more on helping others because I do truly believe that the gospel and its teachings helps people

Thanks again -Elder Anonymous

(Update)

https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/do7zra/update_my_11_year_old_autistic_son_is_being/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I don't post at all or even comment often but I have been a part of the community for years and made an account less than a year ago. I am not even sure if I have enough karma for me to post this and it not be taken down. I am really hoping it will stay and I can get some advice. Also I am sorry if this is long. I am just beside myself right now and really need to get this out and get any advice I can. I thank everyone in advance for any help you give today. 

Basically as the title says my son is 11 and high functioning autistic. I am a single mother and have always done everything I possibly can to help him succeed in life. I have always worried if this day would come due to him being diffirent and what I could do to help him if it did come. Welp, he told me over the weekend he was being bullied for the last 3 months of the school year last year, to the point he was being assaulted daily.

 I just got off the phone with the middle school and was a bit disappointed with the response. It seems their main way to handle this is to try to seperate the boys who pick on him by just scheduling seperate classes from him. They said because of the length of time since the bullying they may not be able to reprimand them at all but they will talk to them.

 I see them being spoken to by the school without consequences as a means for them to retaliate and get even worse with my son. He is more scared of that than anything which is partly why he waited so long to say anything(due to his autism he has a hard time communicating to begin with). He does not want it to get worse and is scared it will now that they will know he told on them and I agree with him. 

I know it is several months after the bullying but I want those kids to be reprimanded. I want to be able to pursue whatever I can to get these boys punished to help deter them from continuing this and let them know they will have consequences if they continue. If I can get the police involved I will. Honestly if I could I would beat their little asses. I won't but I wish I could. 

They made my sons life a living hell for 3 months to the point I put him in counseling because he was getting so anxious, self loathing and depressed(of course I did not know then that this bullying was going on). It isn't just 3 months for him either this continues on for him. He hates himself now and his confidence is just gone. He is scared to go back to school which is why he finally decided to tell me. I am absolutely livid and scared and feel powerless to help my son. I am so angry at myself and filled with so much sorrow at the thought that he was dealing with this alone. I failed him and will be damned if I continue to fail him. 

There are 3 boys. The first one (he doesn't know this boy's last name)punches him in the arms over and over again literally daily, he doesn't talk to him just hits him. My son had come home with bruises all over his arms several times last year and when asked about it he would refuse to talk about it. He can be pretty active and clumsy so I was a little concerned about it but he gets a new bruise almost everyday so I didn't think much of it. It was not something I thought could be caused by abuse at the time. I so deeply regret not pushing harder about it and pursuing it more. 

The second boy(my son knows his full name) daily called him gay, a homo and a fag because my son has long hair, he calls him a girl and gay because of it. My son does not get his hair cut because of his autistic sensory issues, he cannot stand it at all. The third boy(his name is known too) threatens my boy. He aggressively tells him not to look at him, not to talk to him. He threatens violence if he does. All 3 of them are friends, egg each other on and gang up on him together. 

All of this stuff was happening in class. Not the halls, not the cafeteria, not after school. These little shits were doing this right under the teachers noses when their backs were turned. So I am not exactly confident in the schools ability to protect my son. I want to make sure I do everything I can to protect him and put a stop to it. 

All this being said I absolutely appreciate any advice that is given. I need advice about what I can do to help my son cope with this emotionally at home(he is still in counseling). What he could try to do when the bullying is happening. Advice about how I should handle it with the school. Advice about if I can get police involved in this or not. 

As I said, just incase this info is needed, my son is high functioning autistic. He has had all the treatment and therapy I could get for him for his autism and no longer is in any. He does not have an IEP or anything like it. He excels academically and now his main struggles are sensory, social and fine motor skills. He doesn't qualify for assistance or therapies as he is not ""disabled enough"".

TL;DR: High functioning autistic son being bullied at school. How can I help him and pursue safety for him at school and consequences for these little shits? Also sorry for any errors  I am a bit of a mess right now.

EDIT: Just want to say thank you to everyone for all of the support, advice and responses. Got a lot of information to take in now. This is such a wonderful community and you all are amazing. Thank you for the award as well. Trying to respond to everyone as much as I can but lots of stuff going on right now. I will type at least helped! to everyone who helped or responded. I will also update as soon as I can. Thanks again!"

i'm just really not sure how to go about this. i (17f) have known this guy about 2 years (18m) and a few nights ago we were hanging out at my house. i was wearing really short shorts to sleep in and i noticed he was staring at my butt so i just kind of made a joke about it and it's not a big deal or whatever. ehm i kind of sound like a bad person at this point but i got the idea in my head that ""oh, he's a virgin, i'm newly single, maybe he'd want to try some stuff with me"". later that night we were watching a film, and i asked him if we could cuddle and he said it was okay. i start feeling he has an erection and i teased him about it and basically it all went from there and i let him touch my butt a little/my boobs and then we had sex. he slept over and left the next morning after we had breakfast with my parents. as soon as he got home though he started to immediately text me. i'm quite introverted and i dont want to constantly be interacting with people, even through text. but i made sure i responded to him even if i didn't feel like it because otherwise he might get the wrong idea and feel used or something-- something that come to think of it may not be entirely unjustified.

so a few days have passed and he's asked me idk how much times already if i want to hang out again. i keep telling him i'm busy with work/i dont have the energy/i just want to be by myself for a bit-- all things that are true. him and i never hanged out much. we've known each other a couple years from school but most of our interaction was on facebook/with other people. so obviously he only wants to suddenly hang out again for sex. which isn't something i'm entirely against, it's just that i just got out of a quite serious relationship, and i know he's never been in a relationship or anything like that. and i don't know how i can tell him without hurting his feelings that maybe we can still be friends and mess around sometimes but i dont want to do anything regularly with you or be in a relationship. any advice? he's quite ehm, i don't know how to explain. he's strange, i guess. very much an outcast. and i need to consider that he might be lonely or something when i tell him this and consider his feeings"

I think I'm going to grow up being a lonely old lady with a bunch of dogs. I remember a friend of mine convinced me to go to a bar with her and I basically ordered a shot, drank it, and ran out two minutes later and sat in my car the rest of the time."

We've been friends for several years now. I guess it's important to say that her bf and I aren't really friends. We know each other, but that's pretty much it. Guy went to other country (army business) and she is at home.

I knew for some time some emotional thing with some other guy was going on, but I didn't care much of it since it's none of my business. 

When she told me they kissed I gave her a little speech that's not ok to do such things and if she doesn't feel like being in a relationship at least she could tell her boyfriend. That border of trying not to hurt someone is crossed as soon as you fail to set proper boundaries and allow something to enter your life that might have bad effect on you or your relationship.

Now she told me she slept with that guy once, but was only once because second time she didn't want to do it without protection again. I'm just..shocked. Still none of my business but I feel sorry for that guy who's away earning money, perhaps to add some more so they can build a life together. I'm shocked that guy she'd cheating with has a family at home. 

Somewhat it feels like when I see and listen to such things I lose my trust in so many things.

Is it normal I feel like that? I don't want to cut a friend out of my life, since we are quite good friends, but I feel like somehow I can't  be such a good friend to someone of whom I've lost respect."

I'm very kind and caring and I really wanted a family. I love kids and I've always wanted to be a dad. After a few months of trying for a baby I went to the doctor with my wife to see if something was wrong and the doctor gave us the news that I am infertile. The ride home was silent and very tense. I've wanted this for a long time and I teared up a bit and I told my wife I'm sorry and that I feel so shitty about this. She didn't respond for a moment and then started screaming at me telling me how worthless of a man and how much of a nothing I am and how pathetic I am. She then proceeded to attack me. She slapped and scratched me. I had to pull over or I would have gotten into an accident. All I could have done was try and protect my face I wouldn't lie a hand on her. She stopped and cried and then I drove us home. She then told me if I told anyone that she hit me and attacked me (I have a busted lip and scratches on my face) she will say it was self defense and say I beat her to my family. She's hit me in the past but it wasn't like this it was a slap here and there.

UPDATE: hey everyone. Thank you all so much for the support and replies. Being in this situation is rough but I'm glad that you guys are being so kind to me. She wouldn't let me go to work today because of my scratches (I work in construction and get up early). I called in and she tried to ""make it up to me"" by having sex with me. I told her I wasn't really in the mood and she flipped out. I really don't understand what's gotten into her but she's like possessed or something. She was throwing dishes at me and said she wants out and that I'm nothing she wants anymore. 

This is really a mess. My moms kinda all I have left and I called her and told her what's been going on and she said I should get a divorce and stuff and it really broke my moms heart and I feel guilty now that I have to put her thru this. 

The real cherry on top though isn't all of this mess, it's that while she was throwing her tantrum I went into the bathroom and locked the door to just get away. I had my suspicions but she's been sleeping with another man according to these texts and there's one point in their conversations where they talk about how she's blackmailing me and he said it's wrong and she should just leave me. 

I don't know what to do about the money though. We have a consign in this house. We share a lot of our stuff. I'm just nervous. "

For example, when I was friends with a gal (this happened multiple times with different girls) I would be next to obsessed with them. I wouldn't let it show, I didn't spam them, ask them creepy questions or anything along the lines of r/niceguys. But on the inside it was tearing me apart. Whenever I saw them being online, talking to someone else (this was just online, with people I know irl I don't really experience this) I immediately hated myself. Went over all of the conversations we would have and tried to figure out what I did wrong, what I could do differently but never really came up with an answer. This doesn't really happen when I am talking with guys, so it has to do something with romantic relationships and so and so. This was happening with people I didn't even know that well, I would just talk with them for hour or so and be attached just like that. It's absolutely destroying me.

What should I do? Earlier this year, my boyfriend (28y/o) lost his father very suddenly. The father was the parent's main source of income and they didn't have much savings nor a life insurance policy. They were very cheap but weren't good at saving any money due to the father's gambling. The mother would not have been able to keep the place by herself. I lived with my boyfriend at the time and I knew he would have to move back home with his mom or find a new place with her, which I was fine with.

My bf was and is still struggling financially because ever since he was a teenager, his older sister moved out and he had to work to pay bills for his parents. He has debt and owes me money so finding a place with his mother, who made even less, was tough. His sister (\~38y/o) seems much better off: owns a house with her husband and in-laws, no kids, 2-3 cars, well paying job at Bloomberg Business, and goes on 2-3 international trips a year every year. She offered no help and instead questioned all of my boyfriend's finances so she could plan out how he can spend his money so he can afford to take care of their mom on his own. She even said she was struggling and said her financial situation was much worse than his. She has yet to prove it. When she was younger, she would ask their mom for thousands of dollars so she could travel with her then bf, but when the mom needs help now financially, she refuses. She also asked him to ask me to move in with him and their mother so I can help them out financially. As much as I love my bf and felt awful about what happened to his family, I cannot stand his mother. She is overbearing, disrespectful, rude, and always has to have things her way.

So my bf and his mother were struggling because everything was too expensive for them. Not a month after the father's death, his sister books a trip to Hawaii with her husband. After they came back, the mother asked if she would be able to help out so my bf wouldn't have to take everything on himself. The sister said she couldn't spare a couple hundred dollars...And just recently, they booked another trip to Russia to watch the World Cup, her 2nd international trip of the year when my bf and I have barely left the state...

Stupid ol' me felt really bad watching my bf struggle so I offered to move in with them until they got back on their feet but I made it clear that it would only be temporary and that his sister needed to help out no matter what. So with my income, we were able to find a place right away and his sister agreed to pay $300 a month to help. We rented a $2,000 apartment, where I covered half the rent and all the gas/electric bills. Fast forward 5 months, I hate going home. I hate going home with his mother there. I have no privacy (she watches me eat, she watches me move around the house, she took control over the whole house, she needs everything to be her way).

I know I probably threw myself into this mess and now I got myself stuck. I can't just move out because my bf and his mom wouldn't be able to afford any place to live. I wish his sister would help more financially and leave me out but it seems like she rather keep her trip itineraries full. I feel like I am being used and everything is so unfair to me. Even though I said I was only doing this as a temporary solution, it feels more permanent everyday. Everyone is so used to it and is not doing anything to fix the situation or come up with a solution. I am becoming depressed and I hate going home because his mother is too much to deal with. If you were in my shoes, would you have done the same thing and offered to move in? Am I a bitch for not wanting to help my bf anymore and not being able to deal with his mother and sister? What would you do in this situation?"

First thing in the morning, she got a text from a strange number saying something like “saw your pic, had to say hi. I love your hair.” She asked who they were and they said “we don’t know each other.” So far just some random weirdo right?

But then the part that really concerns me: they sent her a photo of herself that was never posted online, and only exists in her camera roll. Nothing compromising, just a photo we took a year or two back at a cool store. Still very disconcerting. She asked how they got her number and they said “I know about hacks and tricks.” That’s when she told me about it and I recommended she stop responding.

My girlfriend has generalized anxiety disorder and one of her biggest fears revolves around stalkers, so she has been very freaked out. Didn’t sleep much last night.

She is an iPhone user, and 2FA is turned on for iCloud so I’m not sure how that could’ve been compromised. Of course she’s gone through and changed all passwords as well. We’ve also filed a police report.

Is this something anyone has experience with? Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated.

~~Edit: just a couple of updates. She logged into her iCloud and Google Photos from a computer and interestingly, that particular photo WAS on Google but was NOT on iCloud. Unfortunately Google’s phone teams are closed because of COVID so I don’t know what to do with that information. She has obviously secured her google account, but there’s no trace of any suspicious devices/logins in their analytic tools.~~

~~I haven’t been able to figure out a way to get the raw picture file to my computer to analyze the .exif data. I tried emailing it as an in-line picture, attaching it as a file, and directly forwarding the text, but all of those result in a copy being created. When she opens the file directly from her phone, it shows a date/time created of exactly when she received the text and I’d really like to be able to further analyze that file’s data.~~


BIG EDIT: Okay guys, we feel very silly for not realizing this, but it turns out that this picture is her WhatsApp profile picture. She really had no idea that she had used that picture for that, and I’m so sorry that I didn’t have that information earlier for all of the people who have been helping. She only uses WhatsApp for one group chat with her colleagues, and never sees her profile picture.

The random creep must have been trying a bunch of numbers on WhatsApp chat and found her by luck. That’s how he had that photo and her number but not her name.

I can’t thank this community enough for how much time and care so many of you put into helping us. You are a beautiful group of people and helped us get through a very scary 12 hours. Special shoutout to u/fangbangr for suggesting that I search the creep’s number on WhatsApp, which led me to stumble upon my gf’s profile."

A customer issed a complaint against me that I feel is completely unjust. She is accusing me of billing card A when I should of billed card B.

I even confirm, ""Hey we're billing through Card A"" at the end of the call.

Calls are not recorded. Its my word against hers. A valued long time customer. And a lowly worker who can get replaced in a blink.

My supervisor is trying to vouce for me, and I'm just waiting for the results. But a part of me wants to be fired because I hate this job so much. It just drains the soul.

I got my resume cleaned up and a few job applications at the ready. I have savings and am not worried about becoming homeless or anything.

But I have this pit in my stomach and I never felt so horrible before. I never been fired before. I put in my two weeks, shake hands, and leave with a smile.

My friends say there are other aces out there, and I know that’s true, but that narrows down the pool a lot, and I’m already picky enough as it is (which I’m not ashamed of, I feel like everyone has the right to be picky) 

Problem is, I love to be around people, and like everyone else, I long for the company of a partner for a lifetime. I find men attractive in every way that’s considered normal, but not sexually, and I don’t want to change who I am to appease others

I feel like I have so much to offer in a relationship, but have never been given the chance to do so. I understand why people don’t want to spend the rest of their life with someone like me, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s hard to think I’ll ever be happy alone. I’ve spent a long time learning how not to depend on needing others.,..but man I just want someone to share things with, and not just a  friend 

I feel like there aren’t many options to solve my problem, which is why I’m asking on here to see if anyone can suggest something I might not currently see from my perspective

Sometimes excessively, sometimes not. For example tonight, he is already too drunk to drive home and its not even that late.. He has to stay the night at his friends house now and won't be coming home until the morning. I personally find it strange to drink quite frequently as we are both college students and have responsibilities. Im not saying his drinking is interfeering with his school, but he is failing almost every class. This, however, could also be due to his ADHD. I get very frustrated because he goes to hang out with his friends and has a few drinks and I am sitting at home like a loser. Am I overreacting? Do I feel this way because I, myself don't have much of a social life? I have been there and done that I guess. I do not want to waste anymore  time with things that seem so unnecessary. I really don't mind him hanging out with his friends but does there always have to be alcohol? I just don't get it. Also it would not bother me nearly as much if he was doing better in school. He always tells me he knows what he is doing. Clearly not if he is failing classes. Im not really sure how to handle this situation."

He seemed nice, so I kept playing games with him almost every day since we met. Our friendship is all online. I don't have friends who like video games and I get a lot of anxiety, so I was excited to have a friend to play games with. He introduced me to his friends from school and besides some immature jokes and comments, it's been fine. 

Now about a half hour ago, I was in a call with the original guy I met, I'll call W, and his two friends Z and B. They pressured me to send them a picture of myself since they had already sent pictures of themselves (just casual selfies, nothing weird). I agreed since it shouldn't have been that big of a deal. I sent them what I thought was a nice picture of myself, and they W immediately started laughing and they all quickly downloaded it. B said ""wheres her teeth?"". When I smile you can only sort of see my teeth and there's nothing I can do about it. I've already been through braces and that can only do so much. Then, B said ""you don't look like what you sound like"" and one of them laughed.  I asked ""is that a bad thing?"" cause I couldn't tell, and they just laughed. So it must've been a bad thing. They then said a few other comments but I honestly don't remember what they said. After that I just sat there in silence while they were talking completely off topic for about five minutes. It's as if this was no big deal. I'm pretty sensitive about my appearance since I really don't like the way I look. I was getting really red in the face and felt my arms and shoulders burning up out of embarrassment and I was holding back tears. They couldn't see this of course, since it was a voice call. 

Then, W and Z were sharing their screens messing around, and B sent Z a DM. B kept telling Z to look at his message, but I guess B didn't realize Z was sharing his screen with everyone. B's message said something like ""Why couldn't we have gotten a better looking bitch in the discord."" W said you're sharing your screen, quick hide it Z. B said, ""Sadperson1111, did you see that?"" I said yeah, and he was like oh... A minute or two later, I said I had to go. W asks, why? I said again because I have to go and left the call. W sends me a text about 3-4 mins later saying ""are you mad?"" which I haven't answered to. 

So then I cried a bit and am now making this post because I don't know what else to do. I really hate the way I look, and their comments basically confirmed everything I'm already extremely self conscious about. I feel horrible. I'm not mean to them about the way they look. They're not the best looking at all but I didn't tell them that, to their face or behind their back. 

Also I'm gonna add that before this happened, they jokingly said that my voice sounds like an eight year old twice. I also hate my voice a lot so that also hurt a bit, but I brushed it off since they were joking around. 

I don't even know what to do but cry. I don't know if I can see them the same way after what they said. And I also just bought a game to play with them too, so I wasted $35. I don't plan on talking to them at all tomorrow. What do I even do?  What do I reply to the ""are you mad"" text from W too? I don't know if I want to be friends with them anymore, I'm really sensitive about my appearance and voice and this was like a hard punch in the gut. Advice?"

How do I prevent retaliation/workplace violence? I (35F) started a new job on Monday. The temp (54M) who was filling the role was clearly not happy when I arrived. He was on the phone with his agency, complaining loudly about his perceived treatment at our site, and was upset that he “was not told” that he didn’t get the job. When it came time to get his keys (so they could be passed on to me) he wouldn’t hand them over, and the coworker who was there to train me had to accompany him to HR to get the keys back. After finishing up with HR, he made his way to the CEO’s office to do some more complaining. It all made for a very awkward first hour at my new job. Throughout this week of training, I, along with my manager, heard a slew of complaints from the rest of the staff about his tenure; that he was degrading and rude, attended meetings where he misrepresented himself as the person in charge, and basically didn’t do his job. Furthermore, we spent a good portion of the week fixing his mistakes (some of them major - costing us thousands of dollars), picking up his slack, and cleaning up his messes (figuratively and literally). 

The icing on the cake came yesterday. The computer had been acting funky all week. The manager started to look into it, and delete all the crap applications the ex-employee had added to google chrome. Then came the computer history.  Porn. Tons of it. This guy had been browsing porn for much of the day, everyday. It was no wonder nothing else was getting done. 

As a creepy/bizarre aside, prior to my arrival on Monday, he was looking up porn/images of a famous woman from his era who shares my unusual first name (he knew my name, bcs he had to give it to the front gate person). When we’d met that morning, he insisted he “knew my name from somewhere ...” as I insisted that we hadn’t met before. Seeing what he was looking up just before I got there straight-up gave me the creeps.

The manager, steaming mad - especially after the week we’d just had, fixing his careless mistakes - called his temp agency manager. If he wasn’t going to be fired before, I’m pretty sure he will be fired now. 

Maybe I’m just paranoid because of the surge in workplace violence, or maybe it’s because he acted so hostile toward me when I arrived on Monday - but I’m growing anxious from fear of retaliation. He was just so confrontational with everyone. I’m sure his anger from not getting the full-time job will be compounded by losing his temp agency job AND the embarrassment of his porn viewing. 

It’s a small facility, he knows my schedule, knows the ins/outs of entrances and security (which isn’t all that secure) and knows the parking situation. Also, my office door must remain closed &amp; locked at all times bcs of the nature of my job, but doesn’t allow me to see who’s outside when answering the door. 

Any suggestions on what I should do? I’ll be working completely alone. I hope our conversation can help others avoid/identify workplace violence before it happens. 

TL;DR - the temp found out he didn’t get the job when I showed up for my first day at my new job Monday. He wasn’t happy - and took his complaints to his agency, HR, and the CEO. By Friday it was realized that the extent of his eff-ups at our site will likely cost him his agency job, as well. He was already so mad at us when he was leaving that now I’m afraid of retaliation.

Don’t know where else to go to. But what can I do? Basically my friends and I were talking (were in high school btw) and my friend has always said he’s in to fucked up shit. But we’ve always kinda thought he may be joking. But then he admitted he was into five year olds. He’s 17 and he stated that kids basically turn him on and it doesn’t bother him. He said thins like he enjoys the thought of pulling out their teeth while having sex with them. I don’t even understand anymore, I think this is real. I don’t know what to do. He said if he found child porn he would definitely enjoy it and such. We were all really disturbed. I told my parents and they thought maybe they should report him. I’ve always liked him and he’s super funny but he seemed very serious about this. I think all the other fetishes were real too. If he’s telling the truth he enjoys rape and children and teeth pulling. It’s fucking disturbing and I’m very confused. Any idea what to do? Thanks reddit.



Update: he claims it was all a joke yet saying he was serious multiple times. His description is too disturbing for this to just be some kind of joke. While he may not be a potential child molester. I believe the rape comments he’s said in the past may be true. He always goes in to great detail into these “fake” fantasies. Either way I will keep watching him to see if there’s anything more. Hopefully I was wrong and he’s just innocent. It would hurt me to have to report him but. I hope everything goes well. I’ll try to update as I find out more. Simply something itsnt right. Talk soon"

Hi there. My boyfriend continually brings this up as an issue and I keep telling him he’s being insecure and jealous when I did nothing wrong in my mind. I can se show it looks bad on his end but he keeps bringing it up and I want to explode.

I was traveling to Austin tx a few months the ago and used Lyft from my ride from the airport to my air bnb.

The Lyft driver was local, pretty chill, and I asked him if there were any good places to eat around where I’m staying. He said yes there’s a ramen or a Vietnamese place nearby- and it so happens the ramen place (ramen tatsuya) was somewhere I’ve wanted to eat looking at the good yelp reviews so I ask him to drop me there.

While there he said he was going to actually eat at the Vietnamese place next door to the ramen place and said bye while I stood in line for ramen. Turns out the Vietnamese place has a 30 min wait and the ramen place has no wait at all (usually busy) and he asked if it was okay to eat lunch with me because he had a client to pick up at 1pm (45 mins from then)

I said sure and we talked about childcare and his wife and being a parent. We finish lunch and I mentioned I needed a ride to a mall nearby (it was almost 1 and checkin for air bnb was 4) called the domain and coincidence has it that’s where his 1pm pickup is at and since he was already going there he would comp my ride there.

He drops me off at the mall and we never interact again. 

My boyfriend said I was irresponsible to have lunch with a stranger but he was chill and I was exhausted from the flight and coincidence had it that I got a free ride and tips for the city while having lunch with him. Does it look weird on his end? Is he being insecure/jealous? Am I being naive? 

At the time we had just been dating for a few months 

Edit:

I have since showed my bf this post and he says he views the situation moreso on retrospect that we hadn’t been dating very long-barely exclusive- so it is logical that he reacted as such as we hadn’t developed the trust we have now. Also we’re working on it on both our parts- him being less insecure and more trusting and me being less naive and maybe wording things differently. In anycase, thanks guys! "

Hey everyone, I'm was told that I should bring my problem to reddit to see what people have to say. But before I do, I  feel the need to say that I know it's a privileged problem to have and I'm not falling all over the place in tears about it. It's just emotionally weighing on me. 

So! I'm a 29yr old guy and I won the lottery. And it's enough that I don't have to work ever again if I don't want too (over 15m). My plans are to take some finance/business courses over a period of time so I can be smart about investments and be responsible with the money. I am terrible at money management. I want to turn it into more money and hopefully get involved in charity. Altruistic I know, but I have always volunteered and it's part of me. 

My problem? My family, mainly my parents, feel they are entitled to 1/4 of the amount. I offered to pay off their mortgages and give them a little sum but that's not good enough once they found the total amount. My family and I have a cordial relationship but I moved an hour away to get away from my oppressive mother and distant father. My sisters are nice people but we don't really have a relationship. The definition of distant white middle class family. Boohoo, I know. 

What it comes down too it, I don't feel like they are entitled to anything and I'm being as  generous as I can be  (which I never said to them, but retrospectively I guess it's implied). The conversation got ugly and When my mom said, ""we raised you"", I immediately thought about how both my parents didn't talk to me for 5yrs (ages 15-20), when they found out I was gay. And I almost failed highschool because of it. Is that raising someone? Obviously I have hangups. 

How do I explain to them what my plans are again and how it  doesn't involve them? Should I speak to a lawyer about it just in case? I can't see them suing but money makes people do dumb things. I don't want to ruin the relationships but I feel like the damage is done. I feel like a lot of people are going to say ""Fuck them"".

UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *PLEASE READ*
**

It was brought to my attention that my story was posted on LGBTQNATION (link below). I've been reading my inbox for awhile and was never told about this........ Wish I was. I'm glad I was vague as I was. 

What my parents did was terrible and in my opinion, unforgivable. But with that being said, they have met my boyfriend and we have had nice times together on special occasions. We have spent the night and had long weekends together. That Doesn't negate the selfishness and pettiness of what they expected from me winning but I wasn't surprised by it either. I emailed them saying that what I offered was all they should expect and I'm waiting for a reply. 

It's easy for people to create these overarching narratives of our lives but I am no longer a victim of what happened and my parents are the people that they are. And accepting that is what being an adult is all about.  

I do find it distasteful that my story was used like this. It does have hurt, money and a long form version of revenge, so why not click and paste. Obviously I am still hurt by what happened but I think a key point is that I have never spoken to them about what happened and that is our family issue. Greed, family and entitlement is very complicated and to boil it down to homophobia is too simple. 

The advise I was looking for was to how to deal with the situation. I understand how people could get sucked into the obvious psychological abuse but I hoped I came off as self aware enough to not be defined by it.  I am not looking to be told how to spend my money or how to be vindictive to my parents. They do love me, even if its in their own sad way. 

And one more thing, money is not life or happiness. I felt the same when I was 30k in debt and now with 15m in the bank. There is so much money everywhere that every person can live a decent life. Please share your wealth responsibly so everyone can have a chance to breath and explore themselves. Your life is no more special than another. I do plan on getting into charity like my post said, but I won't give individual charity. I don't have enough money for that.

She's spent 60+ years of her life helping strangers in homeless/abuse shelters, and I'd like to find a way to show appreciation/commemorate her before she passes (apologies for the incoming long post) She's one of the sweetest people you could ever meet, and dedicated nearly all of her free time to helping out at homeless and battered women/children shelters in Cleveland, Ohio for most of her life. I myself had a very bad upbringing, and she was the only one there for me, along with countless others in various situations.

She's always far more worried about making others happy than anything for herself, and always tries to pass this philosophy on to others. 

Lately she hasn't been doing well physically, and I think it's causing her some mental issues as well, namely depression. I unfortunately don't get to see her often since I live out of state, but every time I'm in town I make it a priority to see her, and lately she seems so sad that her physical situation (oxygen tank, difficulty walking) prevents her from doing the volunteer work she's done for so long.

She seems to always say things like how she's ready to see her kids again (3 of 4 of her children passed away before 35), and that she's tired of being a burden.

I try to cheer her up and explain that she's nothing of a burden, and after everything she's done for countless people she shouldn't feel like one.

I'm really bad at touchy feely things, but I'd really like to show her how much she's appreciated, but I have no idea how. I know during her volunteering she was known affectionately by pretty much everyone as ""grandma Helen"", which numbers in the hundreds of not thousands of people over so many years, but unfortunately I have no idea where to even start finding some of them to organize some form of gathering in her honor or something...

I'm sorry this post is so random and disjointed, but this is really hitting me hard and I'm not sure how to convey how many lives she's helped even in a small way.

As I said I'm bad with things like this, does anyone have any ideas on how to do something big to commemmorate her amazing life and show her how much she's appreciated?

Thanks in advance for any advice, it really means a lot.

Edit- Thank you so much to everyone for the advice. I'll sneak in a way to ask her which orginizations/shelters she specifically helped at, and contact them with the situation.

It really means a lot to me, so thanks again to every one of you."

We were going to a certain mall that day and I look over my brother's shoulder to see what he was typing, and it turns out he was almost giving away all the information on where we were going and when, so I quickly feared that he might've been giving away a lot more private information this whole time. I've already made it clear to him multiple times that I think he should rethink his priorities, and I fear if he keeps going on in this lifestyle, He'll grow up without a personality. Should I do something, or leave him be? Is this normal?

EDIT: [we did it reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/y3Avb)

EDIT2: thanks a lot for all the helpful responses, guys. the general consensus here is that i shouldnt be too worried and that hes just a kid and he'll grow out of this soon. in the meantime, ill try not to fight his youtuber worship thing going on right now and just go with it.

UPDATE: so ive followed most of your advice and i taught him about how to market himself more and i opened up a (fake) merchandise website and he designed his own shirts by hand to upload and list there. im also gonna be helping him record videogame letsplays and get him to set up and edit with Adobe programs like aftereffects and photoshop. hes been having a lot of fun with this and i managed to shift his focus from celebrity worship to making his own content. its the happiest we've been together for a long time and we're bonding way more now, thanks to everyone who commented on this thread."

My son, 12, recently came up with an entire religion-philosophy surrounding Shia Labeouf. He did it semi-jokingly, and has a nice sense of humor. But I want to know if he's potentially taken it a bit too far.

We watched the Shia video Just Do It. My son loved the video, and declared that every now and then we had to watch the video. So we decided to take Shia breaks where we would stop what we were doing and watch a Shia video. Then he decided to create an 8-fold path concerning Shia fashioned after Buddhism. None of this is a joke. Keep reading.

There are 8 very distinct pillars of the Shia way. He has created various ways to honor Shia Labeouf, including calling him the Me-Shia (messiah). Again, I'm not kidding. 

The ways in which we honor the meshia are called The Doings. So named because of the Just DO it video. 

Now listen. I love my son. I love his inventiveness and dedication to an excellent joke. But there are outlines of Shia all over the place that he traced from the computer. He made a shrine in one of my shelves. He taped an outline of Shia to the inside of his jacket. He unzips his jacket and there's Shia. If your child did this, would you laugh, play along, or be concerned? My son's grades are excellent, he's well behaved, and is a kind and generous person. But he has created a religion dedicated to Shia Labeouf."

My dad has a big ego, he won’t back down, and he’s a perfectionist especially where I’m concerned. Yesterday we got in a fight. He told me I didn’t ever respect or love my mom, and that I was lazy, even though I’ve been the one holding down a full-time job for the past year while he sits on his ass and collects disability that he doesn’t need.

I suffer from anxiety and depression, my apologies if I come across overly morose or anxious.

I was so happy, my boyfriend has dental coverage for me approved so I finally was able to go. After many years of no coverage and no dental care outside of brushing my teeth, I was certainly expecting a large amount of issues.

What I wasn’t expecting was a $1200 bill due for cleaning the bottom row of my teeth alone. After coverage, I owed just under $200 but it is still well above what I can afford.

The problem is I work three jobs and still live under the poverty line. With my medications and the rising price of gas, I can’t even afford to pitch in towards rent for my boyfriend anymore.

Now I face a laundry list of things to do with my mouth that will cost just under $7k. Coverage may not go much farther and this is the beginning of the year.

I have an infection in my mouth and I’m stressing over being able to afford the antibiotics right now, let alone the other things required.

I don’t know what I can do. I can’t leech off of my boyfriend and continue borrowing money for this. I obviously don’t have that kind of money floating around. At the same time, I don’t want to let me teeth go.


This is feeding into my depression terribly and of course, suicidal thoughts are sleeping in. Please help me figure out a way out. I don’t know what I can do.

Hey everyone.

Please be actually helpful here, I’m really not sure what to do.

A girl who I have considered a sister for years has admitted to me that the one time she was intimate with a man, that he forced himself onto her as she protested his advances. The incident took place over a year ago. 

Tonight, as I drove us home, she spoke of what happened. She cried as she told me which led to me tearing up as well. Seeing her in such pain and agony broke me. 

I was there for her. I didn’t want to know who had done such an unspeakable thing to her because I was angry (I still am). I was a shoulder for her to cry on, but inside, I was boiling.

After she calmed down, I walked her inside and proceeded to drive home. Now here I am, lying in bed, upset and not sure what to do...

So please, people of Reddit, how do I handle such a situation? I am so upset that I want to punish and hurt the man responsible for doing this to a girl that I have grown to love as my own sister.  How can I be there for her?

———————————————

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone for the advice. I appreciate all of your kind words and suggestions.

I have never experienced such a situation before. 

Looking back on it, I feel guilty myself. That I felt sad, angry, and unsure - and just how exhausting (for lack of a better word) it felt to be in that emotional state. I realize now, she’s been carrying this burden for a year now. On her own. I am only feeling a fraction of what she is... for a few hours.

I’m not certain that I’m the best equipped to handle such a thing, but I know that I will do my best to be there for her and support whatever she wants to do.

Again, thank you all for the resources and the ideas on how to proceed forward.

She's ended up multiple times in hospital from failed suicide attempts and she stopped going to her therapist because her (single) mother believes she is only doing it for attention.

I’m writing this post both to vent but also to see if anyone got advice on how to handle the situation. 

I’m located in Scandinavia, with rather strict laws concerning surveillance cameras, otherwise I would have gone down that path long ago.  


The situation: My wife and I lost our child to cancer 1.5 years ago, our child was then a toddler. This of course left us devastated and our way back from the darkness wasn’t easy. But we gave our daughter a very beautiful grave, and visiting it daily helped us through the grief. 


But then we started getting notes. Written on computer, not handwritten. Nasty notes about us (mainly me though), sometimes threats and also expressing hopes that the child my wife if now expecting also dies. Someone broke the wings of the angel on the gravestone, destroyed the flowers etc. 


I have no idea who this is, I have no my knowledge no enemies and neither does my wife. 

How can I find out who it is, without breaking the law (setting up a camera)? 

I sometimes get a feeling that perhaps it is someone closer to me than I realize. 
The reason is that when this first started, the notes always appeared in connection to us letting people know that we had been visiting the grave. If I went there on Monday, and for example told on facebook that I had visited the grave and planted some beautiful flowers, then a note would be there the following day. It felt like a pattern but could have been coincidental. 

This is driving us insane. My wife, pregnant and sensitive as it is, can’t visit the final resting place of our first child without fear and anger. I too get very upset of course, but more infuriated. 

I want to know who is doing this  - all advice is very much appreciated, maybe one of you can think of something we’ve missed. 


UPDATE:  some asked us to do a list of ""suspects"". 
We tried really hard to think of anything that could be an issue, this is what we came up with:

L : on my previous workplace L was a co worker who claimed that I got promoted because I had a kid on the way, and was pissed about that. But that was years ago.

 
B: Before I met my wife I dated B, and we had a good relationship. I saw no crazy in her. But, she wanted a childfree life and I love children, so we parted and it was a mutual decision. She also moved to another town. But since you guys asked me to list ex’s I’ll do that. 


E: my wife’s ex – she dumped him for me, but he is now married so he should have gotten over that. 


V: when we installed our new kitchen we hired a polish guy to do some of the work. Sadly language barriers made it hard and we ended up having lots of problems. In the end I had to let him go and find someone else to do the job. He was angry, but surely that’s not a reason to stalk us now. 


C: C is not on my facebook actually but I’ll list her anyway because she is a weirdo. She lived next door to us before we moved, and she had this very very, sick dog. So sick that it cried when it tried to walk, it was skin and bones and misery on four legs. Someitmes it fell down and couldn’t get back up. My wife reported that, and we never saw the dog again. C was a strange person. Not mean or nasty to people, but odd. 


Nurse A; a nurse at the hospital that treated our daughter, also not on FB. We made a complaint about her after finding out that she didn’t give our child the pain meds on the right times, but waited too long to administer them. We weren’t rude, we didn’t shout or anything, we just wanted the best care for our kid. Also, when our child wished to go to a kennel and play with puppies, we did that, but Nurse A said we shouldn’t because of our child’s state. We went anyway and she was pissed for the rest of that weekend. 

That is all we can think of. 


UPDATE 2

This is a translation of the latest letter (12 of july) I have translated it with grammar/spelling mistakes /sentence structure and all. 

“you should be glad that A (insert our child name) died, so she won’t grow up with you both and live with you…it is better

and I wish the new baby don’t live too I hope (insert my wife’s name) falls on the stairs and the ugly baby dies and it would be better... Company for little (insert lost daughter’s name)…maybe she eats something with razor blades and cut her belly open…

I don’t think that the child under the dirt here was a good person either I think it was a bad person and she died because it was good that she died… I applauded it when the people that are bad die

and I have advice: 9mm and your pain stop! Easy, easy

I am not evil I am normal and I do this because I like it and I don’t like you and I smile when I think that you are hating this

HOW DO YOU LIKE MY ARRANGEMENTS ON THE GRAVE? I like it much better this way. Don’t be so negative!""


UPDATE 3

I haven’t had much free time today, chaos at work, but I translated one of the letters previously found at the grave (5th of may). I translated this one because it was one of the worse.


""do you think little (insert daughters name) is done and all rotten now? does the naked bones shine pale in the dark I think about it sometimes I hope you think sometimes about it


at least she wont be grown up and like you both in the future there is no future only the end and that is better…


new baby will also be sick and die and rot next to its skeleton sister and they will be dead together and I will wait for it


it sings inside my soul when bad are suffering and I feel triumpf and happiness when it happen and it is the best way


wishing the worst for both of you, soon it is coming…""


Do you guys think this is a male or a female writer? How can one tell?

It was long distance, we lived about 1,000 miles apart. We met maybe 4-5 times per year, at most. It became a sexual relationship early on.  At no point in time was a rape committed. There was no point at which one person didn't consent, however sexual activities continued. 3 months after we broke up, and over half a year after we had since we last had physical contact with one another, she came to the realization that I raped her...but I didn't. From my perspective, what it seems like is that she felt pressured to do sexual things with me over the course of our relationship, and so I raped her in general, even when we were not physically together, and not in any specific instance. But that's not what rape is. I wouldn't know her perspective entirely because she refuses to talk anymore, so I don't try to contact her. 

It's been months since we've communicated, but I still think about it all the time. And I feel terrible, I feel guilty that I contributed to her thinking that about me and that her life has been made worse because of me. 

I don't even know if it's worth saying this because anyone reading this couldn't know me very well but I don't try to be intimidating or pressuring to anyone ever. I'm a pretty shy and introverted fellah. I don't see myself as a rapist. 

But regardless of if I raped her or not, to her it doesn't matter. In her reality I did. And that's why I feel terrible about it. It's also something I've never talked to anyone about. 

I hope making this post doesn't bite me in the butt for some reason or another. "

Also the fact that I’ve been told by a lot of people I work with that I’m doing an awesome job, that I’m one of the best interns they’ve had, etc. 

A lot of interns have been hired to work after their internship was done, and I was half offered the reception job(a lot of interns start there and move up after a few months) a couple months ago when they were in a bind due to promotions, but nothing came of it, and we hired a temp instead. Recently, a ton of people have been promoted and moved around and there are spots opening up in our office. 

I just want advice on how to go about asking my boss for a job after my internship. I was thinking of doing it this week because I want to know if I need to start applying to other companies now or not. 

TLDR; I’m a kick ass intern, and I’m trying to figure out how to go about asking for future job ops at my company for the completion of my internship. "

Is it all in my head? What do I do? [LONG POST] Buckle up folks, this is a long post. But I very much thankful in advance anyone who read it all and gave advice ;)

So it all started over a year ago. I met this girl, who we will call ""Rose"". She was actually the prettiest girl I'd ever met. Now, I have never been in a relationship before. I'd never had an intimate moment in my life even. And before I met her... I never really cared. I swear to god it was love at first sight. I'd had a lot of crushes in the past, but never bothered following up on any of them (or was too nervous). I could NOT let this one get away though. I knew she'd never notice me though.

....through some MIRACLE, we actually became friends. Two months of torture went by as I tried to analyze her every move and every word to see if she liked me back. Everything she did, I tried to use as evidence for either her liking me back, or her thinking of me only as a friend. I was wrapped round her little finger. I did everything she wanted when she wanted. I was totally under her spell.

This went on for two months, and I never had the guts to tell her how I felt. I didn't need to in the end though. A HORRIFIC night out (for so many reasons) let me know that she only thought of me as a friend. Of course. That's how it's always been.

And then I met this guy, who we'll call ""Joe"". I happen to be bisexual. He was extremely muscular and had a very nice face, as well as a very nice personality. I was into him the first time we met. Not on the same level as I had been into Rose, but still into him nonetheless. But here's the thing. He was a strict Christian, homophobic, and was avoiding all kinds of intimacy. So naturally I never even tried to make a move.

Many months later, word reached him that I was into him, and he was utterly repulsed. I know, this is a normal reaction to people finding out I'm into them &gt;.&lt;

And now we reach two months ago. Rose (who had a boyfriend at the time) kept telling me about how much she suddenly fancied Joe. Even though the two of them are completely incompatible. Rose is an angry atheist. Rose smokes like a chimney and does drugs. Joe is a strict Christian, against all drugs, hates smoke, and is not only saving himself till marriage, but avoiding relationships altogether. I knew it would never work.

......folks..... Somehow they got together. Almost a month ago.

Bearing in mind, I've still never had an intimate moment in my life, and this fact is starting to wear thin on me, since I'm a college graduate so I'm not exactly a teenager anymore.

See, the thing is, I used to have a crush on both of them. They both know this. They both know that in Joe's case, aside from his personality, I was particularly attracted to his muscles.

Whenever I've seen them in the last month, they have been CONSTANTLY feeling each other up. CONSTANTLY. Constantly making out. And the killer is that Rose keeps almost making a point to feel up Joe's muscles. Right in front of me. Non-stop. Making out. Feeling each other.

I strongly hate all forms of PDA, but this is just intolerable. Given that I used to fancy the both of them and they both rejected me hardcore (and they both know the other rejected me). They also both know I strongly hate PDA, yet they continue to do it constantly right in front of me.

I let them know that their constant feeling up and kissing was bothering me. I asked them kindly to at the very least please not do it in my bedroom on my bed. We had a social gathering in my bedroom. They sat on the bed. Constantly feeling each other up. They couldn't keep their hands off each other for more than a second. And Rose was constantly gravitating towards Joe's muscles.

It just REALLY feels like they're trying to rub it in my face. Especially given how Rose keeps feeling Joe's muscles. And of course (especially Rose) is very transparent about what she does with Joe. So I have to constantly hear that shit when I'm around them &gt;.&lt;

Eventually, I let them know how I felt, and I got a big speech from Rose about how ""they don't even consider me when they're doing it because I'm not at all important in their relationship, and that therefore I should butt out and not interfere and that they will do what they want"".

Some friends. Not even CONSIDERING how I felt, just immediately blowing me off because they're THAT attached to each other.

In the last week or two, I've not wanted to see them at all. I've not talked to either of them for almost a week. I just don't want to see them anymore. I feel as though they are out to make me jealous. Even my mother is advising me to steer clear of them.

I don't know what to do. Do I cut them off? If I cut them off I cut off at least five other friends.

Thing is, I know that this is probably all in my head. The likelihood is they aren't trying to make me jealous....... at least... on a conscious level. They could be subconsciously doing it.... but whatever it is, to me, it feels very real. The feeling that they are trying to rub it in and make me jealous just feels FAR too real. Enough to make me want to not even talk to them anymore.

If you read all of this, give yourself a pat on the back. And please tell me what is going on and what I should do. Am I just a sad jealous sack who is mad that he got rejected by both of them and just seeing things that aren't there? Do you think they could be subconsciously (or consciously) trying to make me jealous for whatever reason? Should I keep trying to hang out with them even though hanging out with them is painful? Why do I feel so strongly that they're trying to make me jealous??

Thank you for reading.

**UPDATE - Thank you all for the advice you've given me in the last 24 hours. I will heed this advice and distance myself from them. Already have. Rose messaged me if I wanted to do anything last night and I did not answer. I am not going to outright cut them off. Earlier this year a friend cut me off out of the blue, realized he made a mistake and tried to become friends with me again, but I told him to piss off. Cutting people off spells a permanent and animosity-filled end to a friendship, which I do not want. Instead, I am distancing myself from both of them. Maybe when they've calmed down a bit I will be more responsive to them. But for now I am just taking a few steps back to let them get on with their business.** "

He gets paid every two weeks but his money only lasts for one. He expects me to take care of him for the next week. And its not like it only lasts for one because he’s helping with bills or anything. He invests into his music (he is a talented musician who is not making money off of his music yet), he goes out with his friends, he buys weed and etc.
This means I have to pay all of the bills, buy groceries, make sure he has gas, and so on. I make more than he does but we can’t support this lifestyle and save money.
He gets angry at me if I even mention it or if I suggest that we speak to someone about it. He constantly says no one understands him or why he has to invest into his music and he gets extremely angry and irrational the moment something does not go his way.

He was not like this when we met, he wasn’t the most responsible guy but he took care of himself and he didn’t argue with me when I told him I can’t afford to give him money and whatnot. Now he’s turned into a very selfish man who refuses to listen to anyone, thinks he deserves a free ride until he “makes it” with his music, and that I’m a horrible husband if I don’t support him (even though I’m getting no support in return). 

I don’t know what to do, I want to go to a therapist but I know he doesn’t want to go. I don’t want to leave him, I know it doesn’t make sense but I still love him and our marriage is important to me. I made a commitment and I want to stick to it.

Any advice would be appreciated, I want my mature and happy husband back. "

Later on, I’m dancing in the living room and somehow host is there and we start dancing and talking. Suddenly, he asks (I actually laughed my ass off at this) “how haram are you going tonight” and I say I don’t care. We start making out and everyone basically jumping off the roof.

After that, I went far off, made out with some guys, grinding, dancing, all that stuff.

Now, everyone knows what I’m really like and I really regret it? What should I do?"

I'll try to answer some of the questions brought up.

The religion I'm afillliated with is Spiritualism, and the classes are once a week, about the religion itself and how to improve myself and understand the doctrine behind the religion. We also believe that everything happens for a reason and that our paths are laid out for us long before we were born. So I can see why God has put us in the same room again, and why it happened in this moment of my life that I'm trying to find spiritual solace for other things in my life. I guess it's just something else that I'll learn to deal with and find comfort.

I do not think he either remembers my daughter, as it was so long ago (he's been happily married to the woman he dated a little after my daughter) or knows that he actually raped her. The way that it happened (them dating for a while, they were at his house, she was astonished while it was happening that wasn't able to react or stop it), and the way my daughter supressed it for such a long time afterwards, makes me believe that it would be impossible for me to report him. I don't want to cause a rift in the family. I don't want to be seen as the bad guy who is ""making things up"" and as my daughter cut contact with our family for other reasons, I don't think she'd like to be the talk of the town again, especially regarding such a heavy topic.

I would like to know though, why he did it. And why he never apologized to her. Even if he didn't know at the time what he had done. She felt pretty heartbroken when he dumped her, but that's the way I remember it. When she finally told me that the last time they saw each other was the day it happened, I was able to understand why she was so gloomy, even though it had been a short affair.

___________

I have a 27 year old daughter. When she was 18, she was raped by a family friend. She didn't tell anyone at the time, as she felt guilty as well for it happening. They had been dating for a couple weeks (he was 24 at the time) and she went to his house to watch a movie, when he assaulted her.

She told me everything when she was 23, and I felt livid. I didn't want to tell me husband as I knew he would go after the guy. So I kept this secret, hoping I wouldn't have to think about it anymore. The guy had stopped hanging out with the family a couple months after the rape had happened, so I didn't have to deal with him anymore.

Cue to the present. I'm doing a church class that lasts 4 years, to help me become more spiritualized and all. On Monday, the guy walked in my class. I'm taking the class with my two nieces and their husbands, and the guy is one of the husband's best friend. They stayed together during the group activities and at the end of the class I asked one of my nieces if he was the guy who used to go to the family gatherings 10 years ago, and she said yes.

I don't know how to act on this. I have to spend 4 years looking at his face. I called my daughter today to inform her, as I felt keeping this information from her was a betrayal. She didn't seem upset about it, as she told me she's  gotten over it. She goes to therapy and has been doing it on and off since the time the rape happened. She said she has come to peace with the assault and that she moved on. She deals with depression and anxiety, and I can't stop thinking that the rape had something to do with it. 

I also don't know if I'll be comfortable sharing the class' space with him. I started taking the class to make myself a better person, and now whenever I'm there I'm flooded with violent feelings and thoughts. I wish I could kill the man. I don't know what to do Reddit, and I really want to support my daughter and let her know I'm here for her.

**TL/DR: I'm taking a church class and last Monday, the man who raped my daughter 9 years ago walked in.**"

I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

Thanks for reading to the end."

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you."

I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support. And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time."

wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."

Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK. Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved.

To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish.

I can’t think of a single thing. When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, the relationship felt off from right when it happened. I don’t have the heart to tell him because I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed again (shooting heroin and popping benzos). It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. I’ve been wanting to break up with him but now he’s in a bad place and I feel stuck. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 4 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year he has ever not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

Edit: some words."

Any day. If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair."

The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face. I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end."

I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.


EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS MY INBOX IS GETTING FLOODED WITH SUPPORT, SILVERS AND A PLATINUM. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT. I NEVER FELT LOVED LIKE THIS BEFORE. TO ALL WHO MESSAGED ME SAYING THAT THEY ARE GLAD THAT I’M STILL HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED ON THIS POST. I CAN’T REPLY TO YOU ALL ONE BY ONE BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMMA LET MY DOG KNOW THAT HE GOT SO MUCH RECOGNITION FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD BOI. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRANGERS WHO MADE ME FELT THAT THEY LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️"

I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so."

She told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and I cried on her for about 20 minutes. I'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. I still don't think I can go on, but I think I'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway."

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life.

Things were good, better than good. You were smiling that idiotic smile that I love. Wearing that old and faded track pants that I begged you to throw away but you never did. Then you saw me. Your face lit up. You came towards me, held my hands and said the silliest, stupidest joke that I ever heard. You know I don't like jokes but you still make me laugh. How do you do that??

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt. 

Realization hit; I'd never see you again, I'd never talk to you, nag you, hold you, be held by you, give you the cherry on top of my ice-creams because I still don't like them. 

I hate you.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Everytime I needed you, you were there. You never complained about the time. You let me cry, shout, rage when I was in pain. You helped me so much. But you never told that you were in pain. Why?? Why didn't you??

Did you not think that I'd do everything to comfort you. I may not have been able to take away your pain, but I would've held your hand through it. 

I hate you. and I'll always hate you. Because I love you. and I'll always love you. 

No one can take your place. You were entirely special. All that sickening positivity and patience. Was it all a lie then? A mask? A cover-up for your feelings?

I'm sorry I failed you. I should've looked deeper. Should've been a better friend. May be if I didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. Is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?

I hate you and I'll always will. And someday I'm going to die as well. It may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. I'm going to die and then I'm going to find you in the afterlife. And I'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and God knows what else. But I'll never let you go then. I'll always, always be with you. 

Till then, I'll hold you in my heart and dreams and memories.

I'll always love you, you perv."

I will have to take at least three semesters at my new school to finish my bachelor’s degree.  This new school is shitty and not a good school but it’s the only one I could get in to.  I was supposed to graduate next month but since my parents refused to sign a loan for my last semester I had to drop out of the really good school I was going to.  Now since I’ll have to take so many semesters to finish the costs will balance out anyway and so now I’m wasting more time and the same amount of money for a shittier degree.  I don’t want to graduate when I’m 24, I wanted to graduate at 21 like I was supposed to and not waste 6+ years of my life in college.  I don’t even want to be doing what I’m majoring in.  I already owe 150k in loans that I’ll never pay off.  I’m going to be stuck in a shitty job (if I can even find a job after all this corona shit) for the rest of my life.  I don’t see myself being able to move out of my mom’s house before I graduate since I can’t get a high enough paying job without a degree.  I cannot stay here in the middle of fucking nowhere in this abusive household for 2 more years.  My dreams of going to Korea are over because I won’t be able to find a high enough paying job there to afford living and my school loan payments.  I envisioned myself living in Korea/NYC by the time I graduated which was supposed to be in two months; now I might have to wait two more years.  I cannot wait that long.  And the only thing I wanted to do, which was pursue my love of music/singing/making Youtube videos, is not an option because of how much I'll have to work to pay off the loans; how my family doesn't let me record shit in the house because I'm ""too loud"" even though they're always screaming at each other; how I'm not even a good enough singer to do anything and I'm not in a financial position or location to get lessons/learn from anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already been through sexual assault, an abusive relationship, and abusive family in college, on top of depression and anxiety and PTSD from the assault.  My whole childhood was full of abusive and terrifying memories.  I can even recall my father telling me that if I wanted to kill myself so badly as a thirteen year old that I should just do it, but do it outside of the house so he doesn't have to clean it up.  I can't hold on anymore.  Life was supposed to be better after I graduated, I was supposed to leave.  I can't sit around for another two years and be treated without any respect."

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends."

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

2005
It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. 
~•••••~
2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

2018
I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. I'm going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best I can."

Why would I want to take the hard way? I'm TIRED of taking the hard way, that's literally why I'm suicidal in the first place.

Trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isn't helpful. 

It just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more.

I really don't get some of these arguments...



Edit: I don't mean to say that the actual act of dying/taking your life is easy, but that suicide is giving up, and giving up is easier than continuing to live. I hope that makes sense.

It's like the actual suicide will be intense and scary, but afterwards I'll never have to experience anything ever again and I won't ever have to be conscious again."

since I was about 6-7 years old, I’m 26 now and it’s different now. I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do &lt;3 
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening."

For example when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia &amp; severe depression when I was 7, she took a tarantula from outside, threw me in a closet, threw the spider in &amp; locked me in there while screaming like a banshee. That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me &amp; called me a mistake. Years have passed &amp; after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD &amp; a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery &amp; broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares. I’m 24 now &amp; I’ll be 25 this year. Damn, to those who read this post, I need to know. Was I wrong to tell her off like that?"

Currently in the hospital. I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try.

DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S SELFISH. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD. THEY JUST WANT THE PAIN TO END.

And who cares? Genuinely who cares? I've come on here just to rant and I'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live.

Maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory.

I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I’ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I’m so stressed I put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.


I've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. 


And now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. 


I have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: ""I made this"" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called ""spam"" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying ""I made this"" to ""I found this."" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)

What else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these ""instapoets""? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.


I lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job. Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me! And people were praising what I was doing in college...I feel like Nick Drake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw


I've never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things. There's a million other things. I have no money. I don't have money for rent next month. I don't have money for food. Some of you might not understand but I'd rather die than take unemployment benefits. I am more suicidal than you can possibly know. I am trapped. Stuck. I can't believe I'm 29 and in this position. All those dreams I had as a kid about being the next JK Rowling...I've been doing a lot of research. I have a method figured out. It seems almost inevitable that I will end it. I can't do this anymore."

They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did"

Tried overdosing last week but I still woke up. Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn't leave a suicide note that day. I probably won't ever leave a note when I go. Ideally, id just fade away."

I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow."

It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?"

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&amp;#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&amp;#x200B;

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

Thank you."

I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed."

On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

So, fuck it."

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place."

Work in a hospital, diagnosing and treating corona patients. I wish I could sleep, I could really use some rest before the shift.

But I am writing my suicide note and it is getting so long. I am writing about how I have been harassed and bullied by people I don't know. Who attacked me and yelled at me on the street when I was only trying to go home. I want someone to know, and sympathize with me, but I have never told anyone except reddit. I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

Edit: I am a transgender person, that's why people harass me. I suppose they think I am ugly and repulsive. I dont mind if you call me guy, they call me worse things but I wish I wasn't one.

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts."

I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please."

I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too.

in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...

About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that I’m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say don’t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, I’m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I can’t suffer like this anymore.

Sincerely, Kris"

I want to die. NSFW **trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&amp;#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&amp;#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&amp;#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&amp;#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&amp;#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&amp;#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&amp;#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&amp;#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  


Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. "

You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt. I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.  I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.

I fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail, but the belt was chocking me. I tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me. Eventually my arms gave out and I started to dangle and suffocate. I saw people in my life that had died and I saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes. Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water. The next day (or today) I have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other PTSD symptoms and I’m not sure how I can deal with it. Anyone have anything that could help?"

I will not kill myself, because of the natural human fear of death. That doesn’t mean I’m happy to be here or that I ever have been. 23 years of being depressed angry and fucked up and no it isn’t ever going to get any better I fucking know it won’t. I don’t even want to live a happy lie.

I fucking hate my selfish pathetic parents for putting me on this earth. I did not ask to participate in life. I did not consent to be effectively forced into wage slavery and then eventually the terrifying experience of death.

Off to get drunk now to blunt the sharpness of these feelings

yay? i guess?

i almost drove off the cliff. i was so close to doing it. but i sat in my car and i screamed, 

“JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME. JUST GO HOME.”

until i made it home. and then i sat in my driveway and sobbed.

when i went inside, i broke down in front of my roommates and had a severe panic attack and my roommate just rubbed my back and helped me breath.

the next day, my best friend took me out to eat. i told her i almost did it. and she said “i could tell a few days before that you were off. and i didn’t say anything. i’m sorry, i should have. i didn’t want you to feel like i was smothering you.” 

but it just meant a lot that she noticed and that i could talk to her about it. 

i have a great support system, but i’m just living with this mental illness. it hurts. my life is so good, but i’m just sick."

You're dating pool is nearly non existent so you most likely will never find someone, even if you do find someone you cannot ever create a real, traditional, biological family with them.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

&amp;#x200B;

I have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die. I deserve my peace. This is not me. You can have my life. I don't want it anymore. I am in hell and I want this to end."

I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

- Cassie"

I’m getting tested on Saturday. It’s been a rough life, i cant finish highschool, my anxiety for testing for HIV is sky rocket, and I feel like a failure. Nothing in my life is going my way and I’m only 18. I havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. 

I was sexually assaulted in June, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone I trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  If the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and I’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. I wish i never existed. And I’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared and i feel hopeless. I feel like death is my only way out.

UPDATE 9/6/19: So today I found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. And he already has a kid. So he has two kids now. My anxiety is a little calm now because I’m sure if he had HIV they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore. I’m still disgusted by my body now and I feel dirty ashamed.

I wish this would all end. I think I might kill myself soon. I can’t focus on life rn when all of this is happening."

You make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and I get into my cab. You're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. 

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. 

If i have to be alone tonight, I wish it could be for the last time.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!! 
And thank you everyone for your kind words. I'm glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too."

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it.

EDIT: Oh my gosh everyone! thank you so much! i did not think anything could help but today i woke up at 7:00, ran on the treadmill for about 5 minutes(not that long lol) and have bread and eggs! that’s the most i’ve eaten since quarantine started. thank you, everybody, but helping me. you do not know how happy i am to see that people care for me. i feel so much motivation that it’s kind of overwhelming. i’m still kind of tired since i went to sleep at 3:00, but that’s okay. i have a google meet in a few minutes that i will not be late to. once again, thank you everyone for having such good ideas and kind hearts. i feel a lot better than i did yesterday :). i don’t think i’m ready to talk to anyone yet, though. ❤️ If a anyway would like to reach out to me, my instagram is cieraboruto and i would love to talk more on there. i am active everyday. i would appreciate it :)"

If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. Some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. I wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. It’s really saddening to see. But I sympathize because I feel the same."

Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing."

I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

Edit : thanks for the comments. Its nice knowing I'm not alone. If anyone would like advice since I'm just ""waiting at my bus stop"" doing what I can enjoy has been a great way to spend time.

I can't speak to my parents about how I feel because they just tell me that ""Everybody has problems"" and force me to keep going on with the routines I should be doing. I just want to shut down.

People in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays. I know if I were normal, I’d be happy and successful. No one will accept that my condition has made me a failure.

Yet I can’t talk about it to anyone about this, I just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds (nowhere near enough to kill me, but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard).

It's all so overwhelming &amp; no one is listening. I've been practically alone my entire life, I dropped out of school In 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe I just couldn't couldn't go &amp; no one cared enough to make me go. Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed &amp; cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate &amp; stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back &amp; took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I've dreamt of practically all my life &amp; they're so far away. It's becoming unbearable at this point. My mother &amp; I aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me &amp; I called the cops on him. I don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends &amp; I live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. I'm living off my mother &amp; the minute she decides I have to go I'm going to be homeless. Recently I've been begging her to take me to just get an id &amp; help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me &amp; I know this is my problem but i don't have any money &amp; I don't know what or how I'm supposed to do it. All I'm asking for Is just a job so maybe I can figure things out but I can't even have that. I fucked up &amp; now it's too late for me. My only option is suicide which is inevitable but I'm scared &amp; I want to live."

At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. 

It sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal."

I don't have the heart to tell my friends I am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move. It's strange to me how happy I feel now that I've picked the date. I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself."

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"

I'm  24 years old. On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all."

I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

Thanks, Reddit."

some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can ""heal"" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried EVERTHING to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that Really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

When I was twelve I took 58 tablets of paracetamol and I was pretty much fine. I told my parents and we went to the ER, but I just vomited a couple times and then I was good

I’ve tried many night to suffocate myself in my sleep with a pillow, and yet I always wake up.

I tried to overdose again when I was 14, I took like 30 of a tablet I don’t remember and I didn’t tell anyone, all that happened was my stomach really hurt and I was super hungry for a week after.

I don’t have the balls to actually cut myself, but if guns were legal in Australia I would have been dead for 4 years. 

Recently I have had no drive to do anything but just lay in my bed and watch videos. I don’t deserve life. Imagine someone who is fighting to survive from Coronavirus or some cancer or whatever, and they have 100s of people who love them, they love their self, but they end up dying. And then theirs me. Who doesn’t want to fight or do anything. Why not give them life and take it from me.

Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die."

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated. 

Try to look for the good while you can still see. I love you, hope I don't see you too soon."

Hi everyone, my name is Everett. I’m turning 15 soon and I’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled. I have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out I wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. I have to wear a mask everywhere I go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. It doesn’t help either that every adult I know doesn’t take me seriously because I’m not an adult. Anyways if you’ve read up to this point, thank you. (No formatting because I’m on my phone rn)"

I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly"

I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward.

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it."

I'm done hearing how women deserve to be raped and confined in chains. I'm done being told to do impossible things like rip off the government(?? how) to bring money into a house, money that is supposed to go to a new house but instead gets spent for weed. I'm done hearing him degrade my mother and her just taking it. I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog. And of course, my brother gets anything he needs anyways, because he's male and worth more than me.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study. I hurt or ghost everyone I get close to online because he cuts the internet and changes passwords every other day to keep me off so what's the point.

It's been looming for a while now, the urge. The only reason I haven't yet is because I didn't know how until recently, my life is THAT FUCKING CONTROLLED that I couldn't even kill myself. Hell, the fucking kitchen knives are so dull they can't even cut bread, let alone an artery. But I know how now. It came to me tonight, as he rages and calls people like me sick things that deserve to die and throws things and threatens to cut peoples throats. I have the resolve, I have the means. It doesn't even hurt to say it now. In fact, this is the first time I haven't cried all night, because I've accepted it.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in. Hell, I probably wouldn't make it if there was, I'd be raped or abducted into human trafficking before I got there, that's the kind of place it is. I can't even call the police, no phone and they're known for being wifebeaters and raping girls up on the reservation anyways, they don't care about one girl.

Please, if anyone knows an out. I don't even want to post here, it's probably not the right place, I feel like a lost cause anyways. But I'm trying. I'm trying so fucking hard to hold on. 22 years is a long time to hold on. I'm so tired.

Not here to be talked out of it, just wanted to say something anonymously I guess. I just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways. Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done ""being strong for others."" Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know ""you might screw up"" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

Nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when I was growing up it was not. I was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. I was very confused and vulnerable at the time so I felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.

As a result, I developed OCD and body dysmorphia. From that point on I thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if I was perfect. I strived for perfection; i was a straight A student, I ate really healthy, I was physically active and I valued my appearance above all else. I could confidently say that I was an attractive guy and I know now I had a lot going for me. Regardless of how hard I tried to be perfect over the years I developed social anxiety and although I had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and I missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. Slowly but surely I was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. I had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. 

When I turned 29 I fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. I thought I could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. It wasn’t until we moved in together that I realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - Like I was back in high school. He was a sociopath but I didn’t realise until it was too late. He abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til I was nothing. 

After 2 years of torment I finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. My body dysmorphia and OCD came back but with extreme vengeance. I dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. My hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so I went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst I was there I also got Lipo on my stomach even though I know now I didn’t even need it. I came back from Turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. I was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.

It all took a turn for the worst when I started focusing on my skin. My skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. I researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. I bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. After the first few sessions I noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. I brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. Cut to the last session I got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. In the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face I look deformed. My entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. I have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. This disfigurement is permanent and I look like a monster. 

I have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but I just can’t. One told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value I put on myself was in my appearance. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to die. I feel like if I didn’t have body dysmorphia Which is obviously making the situation so much worse I may have stood a chance. 

I have taken a month off work for the Christmas period and have been staying at my parents because I’m too scared to be alone. For the past month  I have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. Every part of my being has given up on life and I havnt left my room. I have been researching ways to end my life and I feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. My worst fears have come true.

My parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. I wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. Everyday for the past month I have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. My brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. He showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. Unbeknown to him this is how I plan to end it.  

I don’t know if anyone will read this or can relate. I hope someone will."

I desire suicide. I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now. 

Mum would be devastated, and who knows if anyone in my circle of friends would care, and I love my mother but I am in pain."

He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day. He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up. 

I have no fucking purpose to live. I understand why her Dad left. I want to leave also. "

[17M] Really Really Really Long. Sorry. Might be graphic. Might get offended. Discretion advised. IDK. First of all, I don't know if I need or even want help. Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me."

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

Suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option? Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.



P.S. I see many of you contacted me privately, but that's a lot of you, so don't be upset if I can't answer: I appreciate."

I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another.

The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better.

I parked next to the store and was trembling with fear , there it was the gun store. I tried to unlock my seatbelt and my hand was shaking. I was able to unlock my seatbelt , but that was it. I didn’t have the strength to get out the car and go inside. I ended up crying and calling my cousin asking if i could spend a few days at his house because I’m at a low point and I live all by myself. He said of course and so i turned the car back on drove back home packed a bag and headed to his house . I’m here at his house now and we just got dinner with his kids. I still feel like utter shit and want to die but something in me wouldn’t let me pull the trigger ( no pun intended). A small voice in my head is proud of me ..... but I’m still fighting this war of suicidal ideation and depression constantly and I feel like I’m losing . Just had to share with Someone."

For whatever reason, maybe it was because I wasn't thinking straight, I never racked it after loading the magazine. So when I pulled the trigger, no bullet came out, and it was the loudest click I have ever heard in my life.

Please, if you have the time, please read it. I just want to let things out. I'm posting this here because I just need a place to scream. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.

Anyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the ""old school"" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. 

Anyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.

Anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. I think I'm going to go cry some more now, I'll see you all some other time. 

If you took the time to read through all this, thank you... from the bottom of my heart."

I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.

It's telling that it's taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things.

Suddenly, some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home.

Standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended, almost like they've finally realized there are more important things on the line. Not that that matters to me, because I'm a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience.

Carbon emissions have dramatically decreased. Don't know the full facts, but I've heard that air quality in notorious places like China is actually somewhat breathable now.

So I hate when people tell me things like how it gets better, or how I'm going to be successful. Everyone beats around the bush. No one wants to admit that I'm a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything. I wish humanity would burn to ashes.

I dropped out of college 3 years ago and I've been living with my parents since then. I have no job and don't really do much from day to day. About the only passion I have in life is video games, and I've recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of RPGs on a personal blog. Of course, because I don't know shit about promoting it, it's never going to take off in views and I'll never be able to actually TAKE that passion anywhere.

So, as someone who's dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I've wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don't have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.

And yet it hasn't changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I'm still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I'm running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.

The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that's the life I've always WANTED. If I didn't have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I'd read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I'm not attending school and don't have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I'm a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I'm going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?

I was so close to the finish line. One of my current ""obligations"", if you can call it that, is that I've pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn't pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I've gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I'm excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.

But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I'm never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can't just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I'd want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.

The one silver lining is that I'll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I'm not sure that means much when I'm a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I'm trapped in a corner because I'm a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.

I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I've been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?

Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I'm useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I'm a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die."

I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&amp;#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime."""

I want my father and mother to take over my house. If they don’t want the responsibility, then I wish for them to sell the home and keep the money. Because they gave me a second chance at life and put resources into me. It’s the least I can do, allow them to recoup something. I know they would rather have me, they never failed me, but unfortunately I cannot go on anymore.

My snap-on toolbox should be given to R.. He can keep my tools.

My biological mother L. will get half of my personal belongings, clothes and anything that will help her keep the memories of me.

Anything else that I own will be donated or thrown away.  

This is nobodies fault. So many friends, family, and doctors tried their hardest to save me. Please know it’s not your fault. Please forgive me. I know that people will question my actions. People will wish I pushed harder and not have done this. I have been in despair for so many years. Suffering silently and trying my hardest to get better; to have peace. I unfortunately couldn’t bear the weight of my mental illness. It changed me, ripped away every fiber of my being. Left me broken and unrecognizable. I lost everything I love to my sickness. I look in the mirror daily and have no idea who I am. All I see is a deeply broken man. I ask that you keep the memories of me for who I was. The unbroken A.. The comforter, the loving person, the selfless A., the man who breaks bread with strangers in need, the one full of compassion and unconditional love. Please don’t remember me for the monster I have become. The angry man, having no patience or control, selfish and hurtful towards those I love; bipolar. I cannot bear that reality. Knowing that I am not me anymore. No matter how hard I try, the A. I once was is dead. I miss his softness, his love, his intellect, his ability to understand and protect others. All I am left with is a shell. I look like A.. But I assure you, he is completely dead inside. Nothing is left of him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot revive him. He is gone, and I carry the weight of who I once was. No more am I actually alive, my fire is gone, my will to live completely destroyed. I am just a shell now. I have unbearable headaches daily. I can’t speak with articulate words anymore. My emotions are numb now. I don’t feel anything. My mind whispers daily that relief will come only when I give up.  That my peace will come when I quit. I have never been a quitter, I have always been a fighter. But for the first time in my life, I face an enemy whom I cannot defeat. My mind is my enemy now instead of my best friend, as it used to be. I know that people will think I am selfish. I ask you to please not carry this pain. It’s unbearable and not worthy to carry. I wish this cup was not mine to drink from, but the poison has come to me anyways. I know that nobody will get to ask me why? Or find the closure they seek. Please find closure in this fact. I am sick, if I wasn’t sick I wouldn’t have taken my life. I couldn’t bear this weight anymore. It has destroyed and taken from me everything that I am. My ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. It has taken everything that I was. Nothing is left of me that is me. I wish I could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. But the reality is that I cannot. Please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who I was, not what I became. It gives me great shame to know what I am now. To know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. I have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. But nothing will fix this. Just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. So it is with my severe mental illness. This is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. Nothing can cured this. Nothing could have prevented this. I lived a good life. I traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere I went, and it was beautiful. My life was not lived in vain. I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family. I wish this illness never happened. I have overcome so much in life, but I couldn’t overcome this.  

Sincerely,

A.

I know this will hurt, please know it’s not your fault, it’s nobodies fault. With the last piece of love left in my heart, though it is not much, I wish to share it with everyone who knew me. No matter if we had problems, I forgive you, please forgive me."

I don’t feel as if I need to really explain much; you knew I was suffering. 

Admittedly or not; you knew. 

And you can say I’m selfish.

And you can say that I’m a coward. 

And you can say that I couldn’t have been helped.

And you can say that this mindset was a choice.

And that you don’t understand.

And that you didn’t expect this. 

And that you wish things were different.

And that you’re hurting. 

But you’ll be okay. 

And I’m not selfish. 

And I’m not a coward. 

And you’re right, maybe I could’ve been saved; but I wasn’t. 

Someone once told me that I wasn’t broken, that I just needed someone to choose me. To love me. 

And that’s more than true. 

How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? 

Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. 

That I’m special. 

I am luminous. 

I am warm.

I am beautiful.

I am talented. 

I am smart. 

I am magnetic.

I am powerful. 

But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. 

Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, 

Just so show that you have me. 

But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. 

And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. 

Beautiful they say, precious even. 

Kept safe. Appreciated. 

Used when deemed appropriate. 

Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  

When treated at all. 

Packed away. 

And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.

I tried to give myself meaning. 

To feel loved without touch. 

But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, 

And my voice muted 

My pain overlooked

My cracks sanded over, but never filled

What could really be expected?

My mother HURT ME. 

She hurt some of you. 

She hurt herself. 

And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. 

IM fucked up because of it. 

I remember. 

I remember.

I remember. 

I FUCKING REMEMBER. 

I wish you’d let me talk about it.

I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.

I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. 

I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. 

Because I wasn’t. 

And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. 

WHAT HAPPENED to her was. 

And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. 

But something did. And YOU know. 

So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. 

Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. 

Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. 

Talk about your traumas. 

I made my own decision, I did. 

Talk so each other. 

Please. 

I tried. 

I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. 

I tried to create something with what I had.

To play the cards I was dealt… 

but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). 

Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, 

but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. 

So I folded. 

I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. 

I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. 

God sent me here to teach a lesson. 

About truth. 

About pain. 

About compassion. 

About how time doesn’t stop. 

Or something, I don’t know. 

I don’t have much else to say. 

I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind

That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin 

When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. 

I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. 

Please take care of him. 

He’s an angel. Truly. 

Here’s to best chances 

At peace 

At closure 

At warmth

At forgiveness 

Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see

No lies 

Just love 

Like snow 

Like gold

I will be pure.

I have thought about suicide constantly for many years. My entire life, I have felt as though I have been genuinely cursed. Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. I don't know why I am posting this, but I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thank you for your time and I genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine."

What’s the point? The only reason I’ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now she’s a little brat who hates me because all I do is stay in bed. My parents don’t say it but I know they are disappointed and wish I was a better child. 
All I have is my girlfriend who I can’t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before I get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. 
I can’t open up to anyone close to me because to me it’s not opening up it’s just dumping all my problems on them.

I always wanted to feed ducks, never did. I'm partially housebound thanks to agoraphobia and if the ducks touch me I'd have a panic attacks thanks to OCD, so I have never fed ducks.

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years. 

I don't have a gun so my death will be painful as hell but its my only method

EDIT: I did it, but my instincts are running wild telling me to tell my parents, what do I say to them

EDIT 2: It failed, I'm in the hospital but I won't be admitted to the ward because of my agoraphobia, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

UPDATE
I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.
I didn't even read the back, I'm so fucking stupid. Ny organs aren't even partially affected.
I was not admitted to the psych ward, but I nearly was. My psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which I was discharged 12 hours after I went to the hospital

I had an ECG to check my heart, where I had to take off my shirt, my dad saw my self harm scars. (My mum already knew about it but my dad didn't, he has not mentioned it yet.)"

I just want to be heard. I'm posting this on my actual account because I want people to know who I am.

Every day I wake up to a physical pain in my chest. It's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through Aspirin or ibuprofen or Tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. Every day I wake up and feel it. But I go to class; I do homework; I smile; I laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. I'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. But I can't. I'm tired. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being alone. 

Every day I cry. Most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes I don't have that luxury. I work at my school's library, and the other day I was assigned to sort books. While I was working, I lost it. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. When I finally left, I stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.

I just don't know what to do. I've never had a girlfriend, and I was a virgin up until 21 til I finally had enough and paid a prostitute. It was shit. I couldn't perform because I was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. No passion whatsoever. All through high school I watched my friends get in relationships. I listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. I enjoyed their company, I considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.

Then, finally, at 22 I met a girl through Tinder. I really really REALLY enjoyed talking to her. We talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time I've been happy in years. Every day I was checking my phone multiple times a minute. Some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night I can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. I want someone to want me and enjoy my company. 

When we met up, I thought things went well. We hooked up. The sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. But a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. Now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. This was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.

But *I* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *I* was too much work. 

And that broke me. Whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. For years, I've tried to socialize. I've tried clubs, I've tried jobs, I've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't physically attractive, but then I got in shape and it changed nothing. So I gained a little weight back, and then I met her. I had a chance with a girl. I thought she liked talking to me as I liked talking to her. But I was wrong.

Through her I discovered the truth; I'm fundamentally flawed. I can't socialize. I'm not attractive. There is *nothing* physically impressive about me. I have no hobbies. I'm boring as shit. I'm awkward. I have no redeeming qualities *at all*. I don't know what to do about it either. I tried a number of hobbies. Skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. It all bored the shit out of me. I had *zero* fun. 

I lie to everyone. I tell people I got laid in high school. I tell them I had a good size friend group. The truth is, I've never had more than a couple friends at a time, and I've never been in a relationship. Every day this eats me up. Every day I wake up, I'm disappointed that I didn't fucking die in my sleep."

I am beginning to resent them for it. I've talked to two therapist. They both encourage me to get a divorce (after a LOT of therapy). The issue is, I really think I can't handle the stress of a divorce. 

I love my daughter very much, and I want to see her grow up. However, I feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. I work harder and people ask for more of me.

Both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were ""fuck you"" (one deservedly, one not so much). I came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and I am getting canned. 

I just don't want to do any of this anymore, but I do becauee I have to. Not sure what I need or if I need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times I have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime I think of my daughter and realize I can't.

Our world is cruel and I don't want to live in it.

I spent 10 years in the Army and did 3 tours in a Combat Arms job. I've earned real medals (bronze star with a V, ARCOM with a V) for actions in combat. No one gives a shit. No one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. For digging up IEDs for a poverty wage. For losing friends. 

And all I am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. It's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.All this world and the people in it want is to take. I have nothing left to give. I am dead inside. 

I'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. I will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. Drop off the baby. And gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. I'll home and work on my MBA homework so I can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. Fuck this all."

I just found out that for the past year he'd been covering up the fact that his second company (he lost the first one, worth millions, during the housing crisis) was failing. He'd been getting in with some bad people to stay afloat apparently and he was getting in debt with them too. He just took his life, leaving only a note saying he had a lot of debt and he couldn't deal with it anymore. Not so much as a 'I love all of you'.

My mother is devastated. Me and my sister are just trying to be there for her...

But to be honest. I've also been struggling with depression my entire life. Me and my dad were very much alike and related so much on that level. I thought he was the strongest person I knew. He was literally my hero.

And now I'm just wondering what this all means. How could he have done this? My mom is feeling guilty about being angry but... we are all literally heading for immanent financial ruin. We will lose everything. He was the breadwinner.

Don’t feed me cliche bullshit. I get it. There is nothing else that anybody can say to fix your past traumas that leak into the present or your ongoing troubles. I’m just sick of being told generic bullshit. “Fall back on old hobbies”. “What are your interests?”. Does it ever occur to you that when I’m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation, it’s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore? I no longer have a) hobbies anymore or; b) no energy to carry out those hobbies. Telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when I’m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if I do, I’m afraid of what I’m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts. Why am I afraid? I don’t fear death in itself but I fear dying. The pain involved in dying. The agony. The fear of it not working. Telling me to “oh eat your favourite food”, doesn’t fucking help. I have no appetite and I unintentionally starve myself. When I try to eat the smallest amount, I can’t help but almost vomit. Time doesn’t heal all and I hate being told that it does. Shit has gotten worse over time and I’m sick of people saying you have to have patience. Says fucking who? I don’t have to do shit and even then I did for the sake of other people. Not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact. We aren’t always going to get closure. Some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that’s how it just fucking is. Whether you admit it or not, not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that’s the harsh truth of reality. Don’t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature. Looking at a bunch of leaves won’t magically make me not want to kill myself and won’t cure fucking anything. I need proper help but there’s nothing out there aside from “discover your interests”. Who the fuck cares. That’s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it, not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it. Irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything. Cliche as fuck. I hate this life. I wish I was dead. Nobody gives a shit until then anyway, nobody takes anyone seriously until you’re dead and even then, they forget about you within a while anyway and don’t tell me that isn’t true. They do. Because it’s human nature to be able to grieve and move on, it’s within our innate tendencies to do so. Fuck this “life”. Living and exisiting are two very different things. Living means to feel alive and I’m purely existing. “Alive” in the sense that I’m breathing but I’m dead inside. Please let me fucking go."

My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago. They were having a fight; she was angry and vindictive like always, they were screaming and arguing at each other. He was fed up with her shit and finally decided to leave her. She called the cops. He got in his car to leave. ""He's got a gun"" she screams. My cousin puts his hands up. Cops think he's raising a gun and they shoot him 14 times. My cousin is left in a semi comatose state. Over the next couple of weeks the hospital sends us updates of his condition; they claim he's improving rapidly and regaining neural and motor functions. It was all lies, He died in the hospital one week later. The Cops claim he was standing when he pointed a gun at them and they acted in self defense. More lies. The ballistics show that he was sitting in the car when he was shot.  For the longest time I never accepted that he was dead, It just never seemed real to me and For the longest time I have been suppressing my emotions but recently this horrible feeling of dread has been seeping over me. The thought of death or dying sends me into a state of intense anxiety complete with Panic attacks. I cant take this anymore; every time it happens I just think over and over again ""Why me""  ""Why did things have to be like this"" ""I wish i never even had these thoughts"" I don't want to feel like this anymore.

This is a call for help.

I met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.

Things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.

One day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.

On the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).

When she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.

After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.

She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.

Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.

We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:

* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)
* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?
* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?

Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Edit**

Thank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.

To clarify some things:

Whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.

I’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. Thank you so much for all the support you’ve given me, and I hope this turns out well for everyone."

(Trigger Warning: Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Gestures, Hospitalization) TLDR at End

I have been passively suicidal for some time. Lately, it had become more active; I was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress I was under. 

Last Monday night, I took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. I obviously failed, but I felt strange... unfulfilled? I didn’t sleep that night; I just cried. 

Tuesday I went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while I was training new employees. I just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. I also got a snap of lucidity. I blurted out to my office manager “I need to go to the hospital” and left work. 

When I got to the ER, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. I looked at her and just said “I am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. They immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. They had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the ER doc came and interviewed me first. 

The ER doc decided I needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. At some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and I just started laughing. Uncontrollably. The nurse looked troubled by this. She asked if that was normal for me and I said yes, especially when I was really stressed and anxious. 

She started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. It was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment I should receive. She told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. I asked if I had a choice in this matter and she just said “No, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. We are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”

I just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”

The three days went by slowly. No tech, no outside contact. Just treatment groups (I painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. 

At the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if I was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and I said yes. 4 hours later I was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. I was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays I have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. They are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. I have my first full day of PHP on Monday. 

I always avoided seeking help. When I went to the hospital, I had truly given up. They were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. 

If you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. The cost can seem prohibitive. The social stigma can be repulsive. Admitting you need help can seem impossible. 

I’m not paying for my hospitalization or PHP; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. No one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. And if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. 

I have learnt a lot the past several days. I entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. Please, consider going to the hospital. 

TLDR: Tried suicide for the hundredth time, had mental breakdown, admitted myself to the hospital, got better."

I've lost my long battle with my thoughts. I'm taking my own life.  


What I am going to do is inexcusable and I know I'm going to put a lot of people through a lot of pain. I can't pretend that I won't be missed, I am making my decision with that very much at the forefront of my mind. My suicide is selfish to be sure. But I can't keep living just because of what is essentially a feeling of guilt. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I am deeply sorry.  


I also want you to know that I don't blame anybody. Especially not my parents. I am going into the grave at peace in this regard. You shouldn't blame yourself either. Anybody who knows me well, knows that I've had suicidal tendencies for a long time. I'm sick of making what are basically just thinly veiled threats. It's time for me to take action, and take control.  


I blame myself for everything. Every day I am doing new things that I'm going to feel insecure about later. All of these things mounting on top of each other and fuelling my anxiety to become worse and worse. It never gets better, existing just feels like continuous torment and struggle. I can't play that game anymore. I'm sorry friends and family, I love you, but I'm making the selfish decision. I hope you find a way to heal the hole that I leave.  


I love you,  


Goodbye"

I’ve always wanted to be loved.  But I struggle to feel connected to people, I struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  I’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  

If there’s anything that I’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  And I could never understand why.  But “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  It’s my fault people leave.  I always do something to mess it up.  Because I’ve never understood how to relate to others.  

People have told me I’m too difficult to love.  People have left me after seeing how sad and anxious I really get.  I’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  

I’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  He diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me I’d never have normal relationships ever again.  My life felt like it ended that day.  I was fifteen.  I’ve never been the same since.  Since then, I’ve felt like I was born wrong.  My entire existence was a mistake.  I was inherently beyond repair.  Nobody would ever love me again.  

Rejection.  Over and over again.  

I’m not worth being loved.  I’m not worth anyone’s time.  I don’t deserve safety or comfort.  

I feel empty.  I can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.

I’ve hung on as long as I could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  I’ve bargained with myself, I’ve said well, if no one can love me, I’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.

And now, I’m almost 29, and I am truly alone.  I have no one I can talk to.  No one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  I feel connected to no one.  I don’t feel safe around anyone.  Friendships feel superficial.  Dating and relationships are far too difficult.  Sex doesn’t feel good.  Companionship seems impossible.  

I don’t have anyone.

Maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  Maybe I’m one of those people, even though I’ve tried to make something of myself.

I just wanted to be loved.  That’s all.  I just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.

My therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  That maybe someone liked me.  I haven’t been able to cope without her.  Now that she’s out of my life, I truly am alone.  I don’t have anyone I feel like I can depend on anymore.  No one that supports me.  No one I can talk to.

Honestly, in my wildest fantasies, I just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  Tell me I’m a good kid.  That I’m doing a good job.  That I’m a sweet boy.  That I’m lovable.  That they will stay with me.  That I’m good enough.  That my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  That I don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  I wish someone could just look at me and tell me I’m okay exactly as I am.   

Being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  As long as I can remember, I’ve never been good enough and I always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  But it’s exhausting now.  I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this, but I know I have to.  After my body is found and I’m confirmed dead, I’d like to be cremated.  All of my belongings can be discarded.  My cats can go to loving homes - I’m hoping maybe people I know.  My social media can be taken down.  I imagine work and life will go on as normal.  

If my body is found and I’m not dead - I do not want to be on life support, I do not want to be resuscitated, I don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  I do not want any type of end of life care.  I want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  Under no circumstances do I want to be kept alive.  

I’m sorry.  I just wanted to know what love felt like."

I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice.

I flipped out on a friend on Facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  He spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, ""And what about you?  Are you even recovered?""

But honestly, what does all those things even mean?  Do they matter?  Do I matter?  Does it really matter to anyone if I recover?  The stigma is so terrible with addiction that the first thing he went for was that.  He was right, but that just reinforces that addicts are the scum of the earth, and I'm one of them.

How the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?

Do y'all mfs just think I can go to Amazon and order one?

I- I don't get it. I don't get it.  I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST GO UP TO A GIRL I LIKE AND SAY ""hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so"" FUCK YOU YOU TRIVIALISING PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH.

fuck you.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, I've only become worse.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking ""professionals"". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act. 

No one will ever fucking love me for any part of what I am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking ""professional"", it's truly incredible. Leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, I was and am and will be unlovable, I should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible


So stop treating girlfriends like it's just another pill you can prescribe. Not only is it not a poor girl's job to ""fix"" me or handle the burden of my bullshit, it's certainly not your right to tell me to find love when I'm SITTING AT YOUR FUCKING DESK BECAUSE LOVE AND KINDNESS WON'T EVER BE A PART OF MY LIFE YOU IGNORANT FUCK I HOPE SOMEONE FORCES YOU TO EAT THE CURB MAY YOUR JAW TURN TO ASHES"

I fucked up. Not in a huge way. Not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term. I'm a lazy asshole. Am I escaping? Am I hiding? And I distracting myself? Doesn't matter. I was supposed to be working. I wasn't. I got reprimanded. And I'm taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today.

So here I am, in tears because I take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally. I don't want to die. Dieing hurts. Dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason. Dieing is complicated. I want to have never existed. Then no one would hurt.

I want to tell people I'm hurt. But it's not their problem. I want to tell people I'm not okay. But who am I to ruin a perfectly good day? People get so upset when you tell them things that suck. I don't want to make anyone upset. So I go through one day where I'm in pain. Then two days. Then a week, a month, two months... I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee. I'd shoot myself with my husband's gun, but I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm too squeamish to open my veins. I don't know how to end this. If I did, I would have left earth months ago.

Just because I'm here doesn't mean I'm okay.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel. 

And even if I get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and I enjoy absolutely nothing. 

I want to die, a lot. But I'm also afraid that there's no afterlife and it's going to be a black void. That's as much a possibility as heaven or hell. I really don't want to be lonely for all eternity."

Remember me. Please. I'm sorry this is so long.

Nobody knows who I am. I haven't had a friend in years. I don't remember what friendship was like. When I talk to people, something always feels off, as if I'm speaking a different language or something. I just want someone to know me. It's so lonely and cold and empty and I just want to scream so loud that I hurt myself.
I was born in Alabama. I was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. My mom is great and has raised me all these years. She left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. I was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. We moved to a new town, she met a new guy. My step dad. He was good at first. We moved to Texas for his new job, he broke. 
Something in his changed. He became abusive. He didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. She was with him from when I was in first grade to fifth grade. 
He started storing food and water in his room. Note, his room. My mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. He thought we were going to poison him. 
Both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.
Even though I was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. Or maybe I'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. At school I had so many friends and everyone liked me. Everyone though I was funny. 
In fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. I started to realize I was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. They started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras.
 My best friend was a boy named Ben. I loved him and I still do. I think about him a lot. His dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was ""gay"" to be a close friend with a girl. He pushed me away and now he's gone. 
I got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. It was for a pep rally. I was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. They changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. So they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. I froze and everyone laughed at me. Or maybe they didn't, I don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. 
I started lying a lot around this time too. Not to my parents, by to everyone else. I made up elaborate fake lives, I still do. They're nothing special, just, different.
My mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. I had to keep visiting him for a while. He had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. One time I was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because I was scared of him. He caught me and called the police on me. I don't know why. My neighbors were watching and called my mom. They were good people. 
The policeman got there and said I was lying. He told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. Then, he forced me to hug my step dad while I screamed and cried in fear. That memory is one of the worst ones I have. He left, and I had to stay at my dads house still. 
He blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. The money, the car, the house, my dog. Just out of spite. I miss her. Her name was ginger. She'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. I don't know if she is. I miss her even after all this time. We packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to Alabama. I lost everything. 
I started to realize I was different in middle school. I did weird things, I acted weird. I would touch other people's hair becuase I liked the way it looked. I still acted like a very young child even at 11. Don't know why. I didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. 
In 7th grade, I became truly depressed. I did ha e someone though. Her name was Mary. She's gone now too.
In 8th grade, I had a bigger group of friends. Everyone still thought I was weird though. I still did weird things, dressed weird too. I know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. She thinks medicine is bad. Pills specifically. That's why I'm not allowed any anti depressants either. 
When highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that I started homeschooling. The homeschooling laws are so lax in Alabama that I barely did anything except play the sims all day. 
In 10th grade, we became poor. Lost the car, lost everything almost. She got a new job in Ohio, we moved again. I lost all of my friends again.
I homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. I thought everything had changed, that I could be normal. It was hell. Everyone hated me. My favorite memory is when I walked into a room to get something, only to hear ""does she seriously dress like that? Wow."". It hurt. We were still pretty poor and I was doing the best I could. All of my clothes were from goodwill. There was one guy there who was nice to me. His name was evan. I hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people I've ever met.
Luckily I'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what I've been doing. It's so lonely. It's so fucking lonely I just want to scream and scream and scream but I can't. I've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. I've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. I feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me I'm not. I posted on amiugly and everyone said I was pretty, I thought it would help but it didn't. 
I've become very paranoid. I'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that I'm dead. I talk to myself. Either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt I am. I'm scared.
I told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. She doesn't know I'm suicidal. That I've been planning out what best way to end it for months. I can't go to therapy. There's a huge scholarship learning abroad program I'm signing up for and they won't let me go if I'm a fucking loon. 
So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only reason I haven't ended it is because I want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. 
I have a sister. I only found out about her when I was 11ish. She's my half sister in my dads side. I don't know how old she is anymore. I was so happy to meet her. It was so good to have a sibling. I felt like I had a real family. She left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. I haven't heard from her in years. The last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. I miss her. She was good. 
Her and my dad won't even know I'm dead. My last birthday was sad. I had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. I didn't have any birthday parties for years because I wanted to have one big one. When it finally came around, I didn't have anybody to invite. It was just me and my mom. I ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. Not terrible at all, but not what I had been dreaming of since childhood.
I'm supposed to turn 17 next month. March the 20th. Please remember me. Please if you have the time, read my story. You'll be the only people to know it except for me. I hope you remember me. I just want someone to know me again. It's so cold being alone.

Goodbye
-mimi 


Edit: 
I didn't think people would care this much. The support I have received from all of you is legitimately amazing. So, thank you. I think I'm going to try and get some help, even if I have to put my studies on hold. Im trying to reply to everyone, sorry that it's taking so long.

See you later

Even if I were to continue living what's the point? I'm so replaceable, I lack self confidence to the point where I feel awful about letting people down when I mention that I'm sad.

I'm going to do this. Plan and all. Giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before I do it. At least they have a better look on to why I did it. 

Not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? I can literally write anything here about how I'm going to end it and no one I know will find it. Not that they would like what I've written. 

I dont care that I have potential. I don't care that I have opportunities. I just want to die after putting it off for so long.

I hope people care less seeing that I'm an adult. Just to see that I'm just another cog in the machine.

Edit: this got a lot of attention wow. Thank you guys so much for the support! Especially right now when I'm gonna start college soon. This has really got me to think about where I'm going with this and I'm gonna try and get it out of my system. Even tho these thoughts might come back, at least I know where to go when they do."

I started seeing a therapist. This lady I actually liked. She told me the next time I wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself, to go to the emergency room. I did that. She told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me. I stayed there over night about 8 hours. A therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. I now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. Fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. 

I plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. I’m really hurt because I trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse. I hate myself so much and it made me feel even more worthless. I won’t cuss at her or disrespect her but this is my life. I went to her for help. I needed someone who could really help and now I can’t trust any of them. "

My cousin(roommate) assaulted me last night... nobody believes me...

I moved in with my cousin two weeks ago.. since then he’s been overly loving. He will wake you up and talk to you all day. Literally, the first day there he talked to me for 9 hours straight... even when I went to the bathroom. I have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, I know it’s forced because I don’t like physical contact and I’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when I’m blacked out and don’t remember. He found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything I do.. right now I’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but I’m fixing. My cousin also always talks about raising me and always being a big brother to me... when I’ve seen him 2 times since I was 10 years old...

We have another roommate. My best friend of 7 years. He was in the room and it was 2am. We’d been talking to my cousin literally all day, because we never get a second alone together. My cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. But he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. Finally I asked him if my best friend and I could have some time to talk alone. And he FLIPPED. He began screaming at us that we hate him. Why can’t he hear what I was going to talk about. We’re just conspiring against him.

He ran over to me. Held my arms against my chest so hard that my ribs have bruises, got literally so close to my face he was touching me... and screamed over and over about how he could hurt me so badly and that I don’t know who I’m talking to. He believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows I’m lying. He’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. I kept telling him to just do it. And then he grabbed my face so fucking hard. And told me to try him. I then yelled that my dad owns this house. And that I was going to tell my boyfriend. And he got scared and backed off. 

Immediately he began texting me about how much he loves me... I left the house and ran down the street to my dads house sobbing. Iv told my mom... my sister.. my dad... everyone believes I was hallucinating.. they said my best friend will say whatever I want him to so his word doesn’t matter.. but he hurt me.. only my boyfriend believes me... I feel so alone.. 

Iv been having flashbacks to my first rape all day.. to my dad beating me as a kid and everyone denying it ever happened.. I’m covered in bruises.. and I wish I was dead.. I just want someone to believe me..."

Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this. It just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time."

It was supposed to be April 28, 2019. Graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life, but I don't want anything to do with my future.

I'm not graduating on time anymore, now. I fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression, and I have to withdraw from my classes. But I'm still thinking about killing myself on April 28.

It would be perfect. Ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements. I know I would never amount to anything, regardless of whether or not I make it to my graduation. My depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life. I've fought and fought but always come up short. It's not worth fighting anymore.

I want to spend the last month of my life doing things I love, or at least the things I used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me. I want to finish my album I've been working on for 6 years so I have something to leave behind. I want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death. I want to eat good food, play video games, and snuggle with my dog.

I'm glad I made this decision now. It's given me a contentedness with living that I haven't had for a while. Maybe I'll actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self-hatred and fear of the future.

I wasn't meant to live past 22."

You might think the ""professionals"" would act totally different. But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.

I’m 17 years old and these past few years I occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons I don’t even know.

The reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.

It’s mostly of simple reason such as :
When we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. So my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. So i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. Then my parents asked what did i say to them. I answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. Then they told me “why did you say that? You should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” I said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. They asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate
Just because of coffee......

And it’s been like this these past few years 
I mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn’t this to much? 
Since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me.
They didn’t 

Just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents. 
But, this time i feel this would be the last...

I couldn’t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who’s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who’s causing the problem.
They keep telling me I’m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you’re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life.

I get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don’t know. I don’t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it. All i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you’re reading this."

Yes, I am ""getting help"". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever."

Then the other day, after two beers, I failed a check stop and got a DUI. Licensed suspended for at least 90 days.

I am literally gutted inside and think about suicide literally every minute of the day. 

I'm abusing alcohol and cannabis just to get through the day.

How do you even think about the future when you're entire life has been destroyed?

(I already see a psychologist and psychiatrist for Bipolar 2)


EDIT: I'm honestly blown away by the number of supportive comments, and zero negative comments, received from this group. To answer a bunch of questions: yes I am trying to quit alcohol, although this weekend wasn't great, I'm using cannabis for now, I got a prescription for Ativan to get rid of the panic attacks, I was going to the gym daily until I lost my transportation, and I'm struggling to get outside even to walk the dogs. Today's my appointment with my lawyer regarding the DUI... 

Thank you all again."

Edited: 

I really appreciate your kind comments, but today was another awful day.

A lot of you asked me  to talk about it, so here is more background

 I have to admit, I don't have the courage to kill myself, but I am still hating every minute my life now

My problem is simple. I am sick , not my body , but my mind. I can't fix it, my psychiatrist can't fix it, my psychologist can't fix it. Meds can't fix it neither.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I am impresioned in my own body. This is slowly killing everything nice I had in my life. 

I know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. But I am being In this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. Just pain, day after day

Every day , I have to look to ones I love and feel the disappointment. The rage, the sadness of my condition. Today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.

I don't know what to do. I would give everything to be okey again. There would be no price I would not pay, but I feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death"

Die alone and miserable.

I've come to accept my death and I embrace it with open arms. Each day drawing it closer, is a day where I am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. It sounds cliché but it really feels like it.

I've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. It feel like I have no control in life. That I am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.

I know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. Grades are going down, I'm not loving what I do, I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness. Hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point. I try seeking help. I go to a psychologist and I try to get better myself.

Im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents, been writing a diery of all my thoughts, not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out.

But I've reached a serious low point in my life. A point where I'm looking for other people's advice. An outside perspective if you would.

Before that I've spent 2 years untreated, including a year in total social isolation. Was told by a psychotherapist that I was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care.

I've since got out and found a job I've always dreamed of having. I am trying to improve and integrate into society, but the effort seems fruitless. I feel like I am constantly lying to people by acting as if everything's alright, by smiling and pretending to be happy. Even my therapist couldn't tell the state I am actually in. Needless to say, even though I told him about it, he didn't help much.

I am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, following any advice given in therapy. It's just not helping me against this.

I've tried looking for a suicide hotline, but there are no active ones in my country. So I've decided to post here and it's the first time I am opening about this to strangers. Please, don't tell me to discuss this with my family. The last time I've told them about it - they commited me to yet another mental hospital.

I don't believe in any possibility of this situation getting better, my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility. It won't take me much more to step over the edge, into death this time."

 Police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). They said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.


With all this story my question is: ""now where do i go to find help?"" Everything on the Internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. It was already very hard but now its unbearable.

 I have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she's in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)

It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? 

I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that's why I needed to throw them out. 

Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I'm just trying to hold out until then. "

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And it’s so lonely. 

I’m not afraid of dying. I’m slowly learning to not be afraid if I fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. I just wish I wasn’t lonely through it all. I wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before I go.  "

I continued living day to day, mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside. I continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck. Then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up. Then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend. Then came a tiny puppy into my life.

Please read and follow guideline 4c in the sidebar. We realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. But a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!

Responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):

&gt;  You are not a failure. You are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. It is not impossible to become that person you want to be. You can be great.

is incredibly invalidating. If the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  And inflicting anything on them along the lines of ""you can do anything you want"" or ""life is worth living"", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called ""empowering"" messages kill people***.  

Guideline 4c links to [a previous PSA post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of ""cheering-up"" is absolutely against the rules here.  If you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch).

There's lots of stuff in the sidebar, especially [the talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) that we've put together to help you be more effective, and avoid dangerous intervention strategies.

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is ""It gets better"".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that ""It gets better"" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  ""It gets better"" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a ""hopeful"" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  "

I know I’m suicidal but I don’t know if I will do it Basically, the depression began in 2014 when my dad killed himself.

No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.

For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.

Now later on, we found out about what happened. I think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life I don’t know. Stuff about that day. But here it is:

The day before, I remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. I think I said bye but I don’t really know. That was the last time I ever saw my dad alive.

The next day, I’m waking up for school and I find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. My dad was missing and there had been a car crash.

At school, I confided in one of my teachers about the situation and I was worried at all times.

I get home and play video games with my brother. My dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. A little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. A cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. We arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and I’m freaking out.

For a bit, I thought I had heard that he was just in really bad shape. About 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” I discover that instead, he is dead. I went blank with crying. I was horrified. I was whispering to myself “no” constantly and I was rocking back and forth.

Rocking back and forth when I’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.

I ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so I was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.

I go home after a while along with my family. My brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. At this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. She was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. She was 4 hours away. That’s a long trip. 

She was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. She was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.

I fell asleep and at 1am when I woke up, I go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.

My sister, who I barely see show emotion or cry. Someone who’s older and I looked up to. And she was destroyed by this. I went up to her and hugged her.

My siblings are never affectionate. We hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. My brother and I’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “You’re a bitch”.

So hugging my sister, something I don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.

This ripped my family apart.

Here’s how that day went for my father:

He was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. He got out and left the scene. He walked through the fields so GODDAMN close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. He checked in and I don’t know how long he was in that room but what I do know, is he wrote out his letters. There were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. The police found out about the crash and where he was by now. They were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.

I have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. But the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. To make it seem like an accident. And he failed. But he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. My dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. He never tried getting help and he left his family.

I hate my dad for what he did. But of course I also miss him. This whole post has already taken so long to write because I had to take breaks so I can have mental breakdowns.

I was originally going to explain why I’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead I’m going to say you know what, I’m not even going to continue. I am suicidal but I won’t do it any time soon so I can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but I’m going to use this post to say that...

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
Please don’t.
Don’t do it.
My dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.

I didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe I’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.

My life sucks because of my dad.
He’s the reason I want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.

I hate him. I love him but god do I hate him.

My mom has her own hand in my depression which if I ever do another post, I’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.

who the fuck made such a sad ass system?

im tired of living this way, where everyone look at you as a robot
as a ""you only here to do homework, we only spend money on your ass to go to school and later you need to find a job""

is this really it? life = money?
what are we? arent we humans? 
why cant we treat eachother with value and respect despite our wealth, looks?

why cant we love eachother and help eachother?
i feel numb, i feel frustrated that this is what we human really are, a greedy little fucks who only care about themselves
maybe not all of us , but the majority
of us are just like that 

im so tired of going to school to just ""get shit done to get to work to get money to survive""

and i say survive, not live happily
because there is nothing happy about our misrable world....maybe there is things you can enjoy or should i say now its just to ""destract myself from my constant suicidal thoughts and my depression""

everyone look down on you because ""you are a disapointment and you got no wealth""

everyone CAN rise you up and respect you because ""this man is a successor!
this man got that company ! this man is blah, that woman got the money""

and honstly....i undersrand how delucional everyone is but....i think we took it way too far

we are losing ourselves in our shit show
and im tired , i cant live anymore in a fucked up world that is
as a fucked up person that is me...

i want this nightmare to be over...
im tired of how we humans are associated with our school, work like we are slaves to our survival
if you want to survive in a crule,fucked up world go ahead....

but im so tired of always being a slave to my needs...i dont want to burden, bother anyone with my survival

honstly i dont care about furture,success,work,relationships
and life ingeneral

i just dont give a fuck anymore...its all meaningless to me
its all gray and pointless to me
like why am i even trying to do that or that? to just breath? to survive? to not end up homeless?
fuck this shit and fuck survival and fuck money fuck people fuck fake friends fuck relationships who they love only your looks,money
fuck family who treat you like a fuckin dog,slave
fuck everything and lastly
fuck me and mylife
soon i will die....
to free myself from my constant stress and my constant highly depressed ass

im tired of living... everything always gets the best of me

edit : also i forgot to mention...
why didnt god just make us less greedy 
make us less ""you have to eat, sleep,work to survive"" why didnt he just made us pure souls wandering around 
enjoying nature? without the need of food or anything? so we all could love eachother and FINALLY no more rape, war , murder
its all frustrating
why did god made us with so many flaws?
why cant god just free us from our suffering? 
the answer is simple ....it might be for ""reasons"" we humans dont understand
well why couldn't he just make us understand why he made us..
or it might be just for his entertaintment
just like us humans
when you are bored....you go watch a movie or something
maybe we are only toys and a show to him..
there is no exuse nor ""reason"" is justified to him for making us suffer like this

is there REALLY a good reason for him to make us suffer like this?? especially depressed,sucidal people? 
like you realize you dont live that badly you start to feel super guilty about anything to the point only death will free you from your constant guilt 
i didnt ask to be a suicidal asshole
i didnt ask to have a very close minded
family
i didnt ask to have such a fat body from the start
i didnt ask to be addicted on unhealthy ways to cope with my depression...
yet there are religions who tell that when you kill yourself you go to hell
REALLY????? like....oh wow
now im really being forced to get tortured

lol sorry if i sounded rude, i'm just frustrated :("

Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around."

Whats the point in continuing on? I have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don't know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.

I don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. 

Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don't deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.

Anyways back to earlier this year.  This was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and I had failed again.  I have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this Christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so I spent my very first Christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  Things were going downhill and again I was getting more and more depressed.  I started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure I had food to eat.  At this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because I was too negative.  I felt like I was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  I made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as I had done a few times before and do it right this time.

My package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  I was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  I'm always surprised when I think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  After that I was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  My court date is a month away and I am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.

I have tried everything to get better I have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  I have tried DBT and TMS.  I don't understand why I should keep going.  I have completely fucked my life up.  Even in the best scenario I will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  I'll be barred from a ton of jobs that I was interested in.  I can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  I probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  I can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  I just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  My friends and family have abandoned me.  I was evicted when I was in jail and lost most of my stuff, I'm broke.  It just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  I feel like I have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  I am so fucking lonely but as much as I would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  What is the point?  Even if my life weren't a complete shit show I would still feel this way.  I just feel like I am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  This whole year has been like a nightmare that I can't wake up from.  Sometimes I wonder if I actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.  Losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  Why should I continue to wait around for that to happen?

Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:

1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.
2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.
3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says ""VACANT."" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.
4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.
5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said ""I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love."" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.

These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so ashamed."

All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma. Everyone knows I'm depressed, because I can't help but overshare. I feel like I burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings. And I can't do it.

I'm so ashamed of myself."

It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them. 

I can't kill myself. I've got a job to do."

I ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and I used that). **Mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because I ''upsetted her and God by wishing for suicide''

I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

Edit: I’m okay now. I’m out of crisis mode and I’m just trying to take each day as it comes. Thank you so much for your kind words and support, it’s helped a lot. Thank you."

Life was going well for me. High school was a breeze. I got into a good university for engineering. I had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. 

I fucked it all up.

It began with me being lazy in university. I procrastinated many assignments to the point where I ended a quarter with 3 F's. I try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. Still have GPA above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. However, my FAFSA application was declined because of the poor performance. That was the only way I could afford classes as I did not want to go in debt.

I decide to do work and earn money. I got a job at McDonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since I'm introverted. I work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. Thought I'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than I imagined. 

That same year, I had relationship issues. Around the end of February of last year, I found out my gf had cheated. Though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. I decided to forgive her and continue. Fast forward to May 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. I'm too in love, so I decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, I catch her sending nudes to the same guy. I forgive her again. 

December 2018. Same time I quit my job. I'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (I had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). I'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. I'm struggling.

January 2019. 20-year-old Honda begins to die. I'm left without a car for a month. Girlfriend decides to leave me (To be clear, she meant the world to me. She was the only one close to me). I'm heartbroken. In a desperate attempt to save our relationship. I walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. I promise everything...that everything would get better, and I would fix myself and our relationship. I'm rejected. I'm starting to lose it. 

I can't live in this world without her. She was the only one, the only reason I kept going. We talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. It was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. February 2019. The last time we talk.

I have no one to talk to. She was the only one I could talk to about my personal problems. I had no other close friends. My relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. I'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. I begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. I tell them about my break up. ""That sucks,"" they say. That's all I get. I expected as much....

March 2019. Me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. Pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. I could do this.

Since the break up, however, I haven't felt happy at all. I struggle sleeping. Any thought of her would just make me depressed. There's no escape from her. So many things remind me of her. I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. I break down one day and decide to message her. I explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. No response.

2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, I get fired. I hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.

I'm a failure.

Same week, I learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. I learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. IRS stated that I owed $4,000 from 2012. I was 11-years-old then. I didn't work. So I have that to deal with now. On top of that, I owe $2,000 for my car.

Recently, I've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. There goes my chances of ever fixing that again. To add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom I loved to hang out with. Since shes no longer with me, I'm no longer friends with them. They were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.

So now, I'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. I have a history of cutting. I cut so deep freshman year that I have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. I almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but I pussied out. After what happened to me and my ex in May 2018, I tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately I lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).

I could have stayed in university if I had just done my homework. I could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. I could be making money if I wasn't a quitter. I'm worthless. 

I've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay. If I live, I'm only going to live in regret...wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything. I want to die so bad. I'm only 19, but I dont think I'm going to make it to 20."

Should I just do something completely fucking stupid and Fuck my life up more? At least if everyone knows I’m useless then they won’t expect anything good from me and I’ll be left alone. 

I don’t want to kill myself that badly but I don’t want to continue living, not like this. 

My situation isn’t even that bad, I just can’t get this anxiety, insecurity, overthinking, depression out of my fucking head. For years and years I’ve been trapped. Maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse. 

I just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore. Im tired 24/7. Socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head, and all I want is friends and a partner but all I do is lose friends and isolate myself because I’m fucked in the head. I just don’t know what to do, I feel like maybe I’ve got some undiagnosed autism or something because I just feel like my brain works differently and i just DONT know what to do about 95% of the time. My “cool confidence” is completely fake, I’m just trying to fake it till I make it but it’s obviously fake, I just embarrass myself again and again. 

Maybe I’m asking for advice, maybe I’m venting. This subreddit is so great, I can relate to so many other sad souls and that makes me feel a little bit better.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great replies everyone. I wish I could give a meaningful reply to all of them but it would take too long. &lt;3 you all"

I just want to know if anyone else has had this, because thinking like that scares me. I don't want to end it, I know my family cares about me, and I don't want them to suffer.

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

EDIT: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included: 

because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder. 

My mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse, the nurse hung up and said ""im sorry, but this is getting annoying"" right to my face.

A diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend, so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches.

While at the ER, i overheard nurses/service techs complain about the mental health patients."

i dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone

the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring

there is no real support either, not unless you pay them which isnt real support imho either. i was seeing a therapist, stopped two weeks ago"

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

""Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.""

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. ""Just a couple more minutes,"" he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. ""So is it ready yet?""

""Don't worry about it.""

I was shocked. ""Thank you, sir.""

I walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I won't kill myself tonight. Maybe I won't, ever. 

Thanks man.

I don't think the bad times stop. I'm ready to go. Hi there. My name is Anna. I'm 25f. This post is going to be incoherent, because I can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. I don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, I'm sorry. 

 I've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. 

The one person I told everything too is so tired. I love him very much, but I know caring about me is a burden. He needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things I don't think I can offer with my brain.

I think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that I have. It's just the truth of my life, and why I'm ready for it to be over. 

I was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. I've been kidnapped / sold. I've been a victim in a shooting. I've been forced to watch children die (murdered). I found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. I've been severely stalked. I watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. I've had friends murdered in college. I've been severely beaten. Hungry/starved. Homeless. There's been so much. And I'm so, so tired. 

If anything, I just want boring years where nothing happens, but I don't think that's possible. Everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. People tell me I'm so strong but I feel so weak.  I don't want to fight to live. I don't want to survive anymore. I wouldn't even call this a crisis because I'm just so ready, so calm and numb.

If my guy sees this, I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you needed. I'm sorry I couldn't get better.  Take care of the cats for me. I hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love. 💙💛 

See you, space cowboy."

I had a job I loved, I was coming to terms with my family troubles and leaving them behind. I’ve made friends better than any I’ve ever had before and yet I am depressed. I used to think I was depressed an anxious the whole way though high school. I wasn’t depressed, I was sad. Maybe more than my friends yes, but not depressed. And I wasn’t anxious, I was just a nervous kid and I forced myself out of my comfort zone and overcame my nervousness. 

7 months ago, I got tinnitus. An incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head. For 3 months I was coping with it. Until January. I began to develop hypercausis, a side effect of the condition. This side effect is extremely severe. It causes me to perceive normal sound as painful. I am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable. Around the same time I developed and anxiety disorder. My heart now constantly pounds in my chest and I have frequent panic attacks. 

I haven’t heard silence in 7 months, and I never will again.

My heart hasn’t stopped pounding for 4 months, and it never will again.

This is not living, this is coping.

All the positive thinking in the world isn’t going to cure me. Nothing will.

I have good friends and a family who care about me, but it doesn’t matter. None of it does."

so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

I am trying so hard to make this right. She was airlifted to children’s hospital and now she’s laying in her hospital bed unresponsive and her muscles are jerking. 
This has been the scariest day of my life. That child is my entire world. She’s all I have. I have out my heart and soul into raising her. I never want to lose this little girl. 
But here I am. She’s about to be 14. She’s a little on the eccentric side, but she has a heart of gold. She’s never met a stranger. But ever since 8th grade has started, she has been getting bullied. And the teachers don’t really do anything about it. This was her way of coping. 
I went to wake her for school this morning and found her covered in vomit and she had been hallucinating and having seizures for hours probably. What if I hadn’t found her?
Why does she feel like this is the only way? I want to make all the bad go away. How do I do this? How do I help her cope? 
I didn’t know who to turn to, so I’m turning to reddit. Please help me understand how to help her. 

**UPDATE

My daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! We are no longer in ICU. We were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. 
She doesn’t remember anything. She doesn’t even remember school that day. She’s so upset that this happened. She said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. 
She was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. 
She’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  And it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one I thought I would have. 
I am the luckiest woman on earth.  "

I want to be happy and normal (and I know people are like “there is no normal, we all get sad!” But since puberty I have heard voices, pulled out my hair, self harmed, been generally anxious and extremely emotional, and always suicidal). But my therapists and psychiatrists and parents and friends just tell me to make a list. I get overwhelmed easily and my brain immediately goes to “just die”—but they say making a list helps. So I try, and I put it on the bottom of my list everyday. For example, tomorrow:

-breakfast&amp;coffee
-homework
-shower 
-clean
-work
-homework
-commit suicide

And if I get tired at any time, I just go to sleep and start over again. But dying is always at the end of my list. Its worked for me so far. I’m a great procrastinator, so just putting it off until the next day helps me survive. 

I know sometimes it seems death is grabbing you by the nostrils and screaming in your face to just do it, but I’m talking about just day to day life."

Wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain I would cause to my family and friends. I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.


Much love.

Please, I planned that overdose for so damn long. Even got myself an alibi! Enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. Legit, when I was passing out, I have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. The first time I attempted, I was fourteen and I was so happy when I passed out and thought it was over. Every time, even.

Can you imagine how angry and disappointed I was this time when I woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so I ""wasn't a danger to myself?"" For nearly three days I was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because I was ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and all those words to describe someone who just REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to die. Three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because I refused medication. It's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, I suppose. Now I'm back out on suicide watch.

I don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that ""for their own good."" Well, I guess it worked in a fucked up way. Now I want to die more than I've ever wanted to, but I'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and I'll be locked up &amp; left to rot tied to the bed again because I've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. Why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? I have NOT reached out for help, I've only tried to die on my own terms, and I get treated like a violent criminal. Do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a ""hospital"" against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?

Why the fuck do people do this to other people? It's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom I thought I had. I really don't want to live, but I'm too scared to try to die. I can't go through that again. Maybe 99&amp;#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years I've never once regretted it. They don't believe me, though. They just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when I'm ""stable."" I'm not a person to them, I'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if I resist, and thrown back out. Nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if I complain because every record tells how ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and ""suicidal"" I am. No rights, no problems.

How is this okay? How is this the world I live in? How can I possibly want to live? Why am I put through all this just for trying to die?"

I'm 26. Please don't hate me, I already hate myself more than you ever will. I wasn't always this way.  But sometime around 2011, I began to notice that I felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children.  They aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but I would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.

That sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, I've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  It mostly pertained to people my age...but then I accidentally came across a kid (Google Image, I don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  I was horrified.

I know this is really, really gross and sick, I know.  It's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  I had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, I had no one.  Trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.

Believe me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.  I nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in March.  Please, please, just...be kind.  That's all I want.  I've never felt more alone."

I am going broke from legal fees, bills, and unexpected expenses. The job I lost was only part-time but that $400 a month matters. My ex destroyed my credit so I can't even rely on that. My electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and I don't have the money to pay the rest of the bill.

I have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and I moved so I didn't get the bill. My cat is epileptic and takes medication. She has to get bloodwork every year and I don't know how I am going to afford both the old bill and the new one. I'm so fucking useless that I can't even properly take care of my cat.

I have a new boyfriend but I'm having trouble enjoying it. He reached out to play with my hair yesterday and I flinched so obviously that he pulled back. He told me it's okay, he understands, and even apologized to me for scaring me. *He* apologized to *me* like he did something wrong. I'm the one that's so broken that I pull away from kindness. He deserves so much better than what I can offer.

I am exhausted to the bone. I'm averaging 3 hours of sleep a night and it's interrupted by nightmares. Every noise sends me into a panic and I feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on.

My anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere. I can't leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way. I can only go out when I am with someone and I just feel so goddamn pathetic asking people to come with me to the store. The panic attacks are brutal and I find myself hoping one will just give me a heart attack and be done with it.

I'm just so fucking tired of fighting and getting nowhere. Every time I think things are getting better, something happens and they get worse."

Many nights, as I am laying in bed, I think about you lot and all those we have lost. I think about the posts I have read on here, of those I have replied to and those who came here to say goodbye. I remember and I wonder, did she walk off into the woods that night to overdose in peace, did he hang himself in his basement, did he jump from the top of those offices and did she walk away into the cold to never be seen again? Did these people go through with it or where they persuaded otherwise, did they succeed and did they find the peace and release they wanted?

For the most part, we rarely learn your names, we are usually only left to remember your reddit username and even then, this is one of the only things we know about you. I will be honest, I do not actually remember your usernames for I see so many everyday but I do remember you guys. I think about you often and I just hope that you did find the peace you went to seek. I hope that you found what you were looking for, or something better. If you are still with us, I hope you found that epiphany instead, the one so many of us are fortunate enough to have, and I hope you learned what you have to live for.

But for those of you who came here to say goodbye, I do respect you all so much. In reading your words, I am pleased to know that you had thought it through and though you were wanting to end the pain, you did it for the happiness that peace would bring - you knew what you were doing and truly wanted it and were not just doing it out of desperation on the instance of of a thought.

I just want you guys to know that, though we may not know, or remember, your names, we do think of you often. You are remembered by those that did not know you and truly missed by those who did. You were remembered and all of you always will be. Good luck to everyone reading this and to the memories of those who no longer can. See you in another life, brother.

This is for those who helped to save others. This is for those who could not be saved. This is for those who may need saving. This is for those who are reading this. This is for those who are not. This is for those who no longer can. This is for you. See you in another life, brother."

Your parents and grandparents age. They inquire ceaselessly after your condition. You lie again. You say things are fine, the social life survives, you enjoy work. You enjoy nothing. You drink. You smoke. You masturbate. You cry some more.

Nothing changes. Spring fills fragrant the air and summer brings its heavy trod. The autumn wind bites and the weeks stretch on. The days grow longer then shorter again. The walk is the same. The work is the same. The nights are the same. The sun and moon and stars and horizon are the same. You are the same.

Nothing changes."

It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things. Maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. Death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level. 

I have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. While those I care about thought I've gotten better, the reality is, I've just gotten better at hiding it. There are nights that I lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. It's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. Nothing good is sustained. Life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. Every bad decision plagues me and losses I've suffered haunt my thoughts. On the rare occasion I attempt to reach out, I know I will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. There is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line. 

Night before last, while lying awake, I realized I understood people who committed suicide. That scared me. I am in a dark place and I have never felt more alone in my life. This is a time where I could have used the most support. At this time I no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. It's taking so much effort and I need to put everything I have left into my children. They have to be my primary focus and I'm just not sure I have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc."

It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.

##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.  "

I have been seriously planning to kill myself today - I have enough sedatives for a lethal dose, and I’ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot, but I’ve been fighting the urge all day and I finally tried to call someone.

The fact that the lines were so busy made me realise I’m not alone - there must be countless people trying to call my country’s helplines and somehow it’s oddly comforting to know that the reason I can’t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge.

I’ll keep trying to get through because I need someone to tell me I have a reason to keep living, but I just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation. 

It’s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket. There may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out, whilst I am just very close to acting. Who am I to take their place in the queue?

I guess it’s just strangely helpful to know that there are so many people feeling the same way I do.

Hello, past a year or two I been having a hard time keeping a job. I just ether don’t like the job, the people there, I feel like I’m always doing something wrong, I hate waking up and wasting my whole day there.

I don’t care about money like really I rather live on the streets or just be dead but my parents keep telling me the same stuff over and over, saying how “Everyone hates working” or “what do you expect to do in life, just sit in our house forever doing nothing” or “that’s life for you, man up stop acting like a kid your a adult now”..
I have a job right now, but honestly I just want to quit.
I managed to keep this job for 3 months but I don’t know what I’m gonna do,All I think about is I’m
going have to work everyday of my life and I have a hard time making it thru one day.. A day feels like for ever, idk everyday it feels like Its my last day.
I just hate living since I can’t function like a normal person for some reason it seems like everyone is able to do everything better then me and I’m just a mistake..
I’m on antidepressants they helped me to get the job I mentioned and probably why I stayed so long but there not helping much I think my depression got worst but idk..

For the past 2 years I've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, I wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day I'm gonna hang myself.

I'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. Losing touch with my only few friends. Been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when I was about 9. I've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. I'm hopeless cause I'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. I'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.

Love only gives me negative feelings. It makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize I'm not good enough. All the stuff I haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. For the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague I have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. Better end it before yet another all time low. I have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal. So hopefully 14/02 will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance.

Thanks for your interest I've you've been reading untill this point."

I’m just putting this out there because Reddit seems to be the only place I can talk freely.    
    
I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here. I found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any I have felt in years. There are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief I feel. It's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.      
      
Since I'm not really sure what to think and how to react, it has helped so much to read your messages. I will prepare something, some kind of *ongaeshi*, I will post it up soon!     
     
Once again.....    
Thank you for caring about me."

Feeling that way now! I suffer from depression, clearly. However, this Holiday season I have been feeling it extra hard, and I don't know why. I have tried to do everything I can to cheer myself up. I've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. Tried dressing a lot nicer at work. Figured fake it until I make it. It's worked in the past. But last night I found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. I used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. Then over time I would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. I don't have any more. I bought a Kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. Just ending up cutting a little. However, last night I found myself wanting to buy a gun. However, with me as someone who likes guns I want the gun to have meaning. Isn't that fucked up? Like almost anyone will do, but I wanted something specific. Found one that was almost exactly what I wanted and priorly owned, but didn't end up purchasing it. Instead I drove around for a bit and just meditated. Although I am debating going back there today, getting that gun, driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car... 

I hate hurting people. I have seen what suicide has done to people. My best friend killed himself while drunk almost 5 years ago. It tore everything apart. My girlfriend's brother killed himself shortly before Thanksgiving and it has torn her apart. I have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down. I also fear what does or doesn't come next. I most likely won't do shit, as I am a coward and I care too much, but damn do I want to just end my suffering..."

I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

&amp;#x200B;

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

&amp;#x200B;

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

I posted this here, as she posted on this subreddit this month, and I want to help and talk to people who feel this way, because I have felt like this before. I also posted this on Suicide Bereavement. "

It hurts So I don't think this will stop people from ending their but maybe it will make someone rethink it. Today I tried to overdosed on 1000mg of antidepressants, at about 8:30pm I took ten pills and waited.

Now obviously, I didn't die. But it feels like I am. After about an hour I got dozy, had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff. I wasn't scared, I wasn't sad I was just so groggy. Ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache.

For half an hour I threw up stomach acid violently. I felt like I was going to pass out, so I went to my room to lay down, hell I should've gone to a hospital. The dizziness got worse and I was gagging constantly. I couldnt lay down without hurting, I couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question. Even now, almost four hours later my body is in small spasms and I'm having a hard time just typing because my body is shaking uncontrollably.

My head still hurts and I cant focus on much, Im exhausted and I cant sleep. This isnt fun, I wish that I didnt do this honestly. I wish I didnt try like this. So if you read this and youre thinking of ending your life with pills, just give it a second thought because its not a painless death."

I feel paralyzed. I barely had enough energy to open up the computer. I don’t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. I’d been in the shower for almost an hour and I just can’t get it out. It’s crippling me and I’m helpless. I have no one else to tell this and I just want to kill myself. I just want the pain to end.

I feel so much hate and anger but I can’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. I hate you so much for letting them do this to me. I hate you so much for doing absolutely *nothing* while they raped me. Is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? None of this would’ve happened if mom was still here. She would’ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.

You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That’s how much I love you. Do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you’d do for me? You only had to show a little of it dad. You only had to stay sober. You only had to remember that I’m always here for you. But no, you chose the bottle over me. And I didn’t mind cleaning up after you. I didn’t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell. It’s the demons you brought in with you. You let them take control of you. You let them hurt me. But I still love you dad. I always will. Maybe when I’m gone I could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.


I needed to tell all of this to you dad. I needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but I don’t have the courage and you don’t have your mind. I hope it’s not you who finds me. Sweet dreams dad. Remember me and please forgive me."

Yesterday I intended to kill myself. My ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. When my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. She was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but I could feel her whole body shaking.

She sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. Just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. But even half an hour later I could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. She was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. Later, when I went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. It was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.

I knew she would be sad, but I still underestimated how much she cared. I don't know if I'll ever forget that feeling. I don't think I should.

I wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like I do. I was wrong. You might be too. There are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when I thought they did. There's at least one who cares a whole lot more than I gave her credit for. "

What's the point of going on when you lost everything? No family anymore, no gf anymore, no joy in life anymore, no pursuit of knowledge, due to depression confiding you to a bed, no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi-weekly while executives earn 10-100x your salary for your menial work.

I read that Alan Turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during World War 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. His hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. Was he weak? No, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.

We're told suicide is selfish. But if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? Where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?

Nobody wants to hear your problems. If you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. Life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. People will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized. Then you ask yourself am I doing enough, is it worth bringing up, or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made?"

People used to ask me when I was a kid if I had any siblings and I would always point to my older brother and say ""He's my brother"". 

Now I just say I'm an only child and leave it at that. Half of my friends don't know I had a brother, because I don't want to mention it. 

Well, here goes the story that I never told anyone before. Me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. We used to do everything together. Play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. But with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. 

I used to say rude things to him, I used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but I never really meant it. 
So my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. I remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that I never really know what until I later realized it was about anxiety. 

He taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. It was fun, I used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far It would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. 

Every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when I was just waking up. Sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.

So one day, I woke up. I looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. I guess I slept longer than him, but I never do. He usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. I checked the time and it was 11 am. 
I made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. 
He would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when I did but no one came out the room. I opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. 

That's when I looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. 

I saw the closet was mildly open and that's when I saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. I saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. I remember his skin color looked odd. I thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. I saw something was holding him up and then I saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. I didn't know what he was doing, I thought it was a prank he made to scare me. I touched his chest and then pushed him. I then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. By then tears were on my eyes.

But I can tell you right now, if I had to choose something that tore me apart more... My brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, I would have chose parents reaction. 

My dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason I just didn't want to be in that room anymore and I let myself out to the hallway. Then I heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. I think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. They started sobbing. I went to peek back in the room and then I saw my dad shaking and whimpering. He was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. My mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. I didn't notice it but I was crying too. My whole body was shaking. 

I ripped up all my paper in my room and I felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, I then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. I never wanted to leave the room, and all I could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that I was in. I tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, I used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, I scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but I never woke up. I never woke up.

Every night now, I always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now.

Parents were so worried about me they forced me to hang around with neighbours that didn't like me that at all. I was neglected and made fun off every since. I also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. Now I'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, I'm in a club, looking better... But scared of future and everything. I have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing I must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. I'm OK with family - but I never told them I want to kill myself. I plan to visit a Halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens I'm gonna overdose. I just wanna feel loved at once.

But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a ""grudge"" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, ""I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself.""

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, ""What? What did you just say?""

""I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already.""

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was ""nice"", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.

did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities I used to love and harmed myself. 

started having suicidal thoughts and a year after I attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.

was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend. i've been so happy with him these past months. but with him only. i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before, except when i was spending time with him. 

i don't have any goals in life anymore, i can't go to college and i work minimum wage. also, i'm really sensitive about what's going on in the world and it makes me loose hope for humanity. 

i don't think life sucks, i genuinely just believe living isn't for everyone. some people are able to make the most of it and find happiness, but some just don't have the right mentally and tools and it should be okay for them to leave if that's what makes them happy. 

it hurts to have someone you love die, i understand that, but what good does it make to try and keep someone who isn't happy and won't be happy in the future and let them suffer for years to come? wouldn't that hurt? 

also before you guys mention my boyfriend, yeah i love him, but love never really lasts. and at this point, i'm so sensitive that if we ever have a fight or go through a rough time, I would definitely break and kill myself, cause he's pretty much the only thing that still makes me genuinely happy. and i can't imagine how bad it would be if i left that way, i don't want him to blame himself, he doesn't deserve that. i would rather leave when we're still on great terms."

Even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless I just need to vent.

I'm a single gay man in my late 30's. Seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. Been there, done that. Have a couple of college degrees. I don't drink or do drugs.

I always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. I found myself working with autistic children and public service which I liked, but it's not a stable job. I had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). Realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, I quickly landed a job in corporate America.

Then I was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the DA, I got five years probation and two suspended sentence. I was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. A year into probation, I got violated for having a bullet. Ironically, I had purchased a gun in case I was facing serious time. So I went to prison for two years. It was awful. There was nothing rehabilitative about it. While everyone talked about getting high once they got out, I talked about getting a job.

I was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. I found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. A year later, it went out of business. I said ""fuck it"" and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. It worked. I landed the highest-paying job I ever got. With health insurance too. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

Lately I had been feeling suicidal. Burned out. Anxious. Overwhelmed. The one thing that kept me going was my job. It took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).

Then I got fired today.

Not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. It's beyond me how they found out. I think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. I was a good worker. I left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. I can't do this again. It's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. That's a lie. Been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. It had to be up to me.

To keep on trying to make it is senseless. It's insanity.

I called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. He was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. I wasn't expecting anything.

I think he understood. Killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.

I've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. I thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told I have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. I'd rather die and leave my savings to her. I feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).

There is this part of me that fears death less. What I fear is my future. At least death is inevitable.

Again, not expecting anything life changing on here. The next few days will be brutal. I have crossed a point of no return today.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass, binge eating and sleeping. I looked in the mirror and look like shit. My apartment is a wreck. I thought to myself what my next step is and all of them were ""tying"" up loose ends. It's just too complicated, high-risk low-reward, expensive, much pressure, etc. to move on with life. It takes up too much of my life and I was already dealing with too much and I don't have the energy to do it anymore. People like me who choose life under these circumstances end up going back to prison and/or on the streets. I'd rather die."

Dec 8th, 2018

I am so sorry to all of you! I did end up overdosing, but not enough to finish the job. I ended up getting really sick though and puking on pretty much everything. I have a traumatic brain injury (childhood abuse and concussions) and so it affected me a ton because of that. I spent the last several days not able to focus my eyes. I would wander around my room like a zombie, not able to comprehend pretty much anything. I am on a ton of meds for other medical stuff and I got really sick from not taking my meds when I was not able to think clearly. I am finally able to read (and comprehend), otherwise, I would have updated you all... I honestly didn't think my post would get any attention, and I remember only bits and pieces of the last several days. I am still not to 100% but no one knows, except for my friend who has also attempted; I didn't want any judgment. 

I am doing okay, had some SI's creep in again but I beat them back. I am still in a daze that I could have died... and I was, and am still, okay with that, but now it feels like life is super surreal... 

You are all really kind, and seeing this much love from so many strangers has helped me in a significant way"

I don’t want my family to receive the stigma from my suicide. People will think they have failed me or that our family is broken. It’s not true, it’s me and my fault. 
People can say you’ll be dead so why would you care. Truth is we don’t know for sure what happens after death."

I don’t want to tell anyone that I was minutes away from killing myself. But that’s exactly what just happened. 

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. 

When I go home I’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help I’ve been procrastinating on getting. I’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight. 

The timing of everything that happened tonight wasn’t a coincidence at all. "

We've had a sudden uptick of anonymous people (or possibly one energetic person) clicking ""report"" and specifying something like ""viable threat of self-harm"" as the report reason.  We have no idea what the motivation is for these reports, but this is a dangerous and ill-advised practice for the following reasons:

1. Reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter.  This is entirely outside the moderators' control.

2. The criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random, and [do not correspond to established, evidence-based risk assessment criteria](http://redd.it/1c7nqf).

3.  Most of the reported posts have had some good, supportive responses, so there doesn't appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators.  

4.  What it says in the sidebar is true - we don't have the resources to trace the source of any post, but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting.  So we'd like to point out that ""outing"" someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it, especially in the long term, by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings.  Involuntary interventions are almost never necessary, and almost always traumatic.  It's important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention.  It saves far more lives than it costs.  The times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions, as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it.  

If you think an OP needs any kind of special help or intervention from the SW mod team, please [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch), thanks.  "

Just got Facebook timeline and saw something... I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

**tl;dr - Sister jokingly asked if I was still alive after I almost killed myself.**"

I've been suffering for a long time, the only reason I'm putting up with it and haven't just killed myself already is basically for my family. So they won't have to find my body, so I won't leave the couple of friends I have alone, so no one else will have to suffer like I'm being forced to. But no, yeah, I'M the selfish one.

I feel like I’ve let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. Killing myself would just be doing them a favor. At least I would no longer be a burden. The people I thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process.

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying.

I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it. 

Goodbye for now,

Not to my family that left me alone. 

Not to the land or the house that I own. 

Not to the West where my heart says I should be. 

Not to the places I would one day see.

Not to the bed where I lay down at night. 

Not to my “friends” who stay out of sight. 

Each day it gets harder and harder to stay.

Afraid to tell anyone the things I should say.

My mind has betrayed me like everything else.

I finally realize, I have to do it myself. 

The truth that I find so incredibly sad:

I have no home. Not like I once had.

I am tired. I am weak. I am angry. Alone. 

I have made up my mind...

This morning, I took my rope that I have (the only rope I had, specifically for that purpose) and I threw it in the trash. I ripped up my suicide note. I've told myself that I'm going to stay here and fight, even if I don't win, I'm going to give it a damn good go. 

It might seem rather insignificant, but throwing that rope away, the rope that was always there for me to use if I felt like it, is a big step for me. "

People keep trying to talk me out of it. I don't get why. They keep using different types of arguments, and I really don't believe in any of them.

Is it selfish because of the people who care about you? Well, how is me living a life I don't want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them? Moreover, what about the people who have no one to care for them?(Not my case, but still, it's quite a common cause of suicide)

Is it cowardly? I really don't think so. Every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it, so coming to the decision, and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination.

Do things get better? Well, what if they fucking DON'T? For years, I keep hoping to get to a better life, to start properly enjoying it, but it just doesn't work out. I even moved to a different country, hoping for a new(and better) life. Truth be told, I'm just not meant to live a good life. I don't know, maybe I was a massive asshole in a past life(if that's a thing) and now karma is working its way.

People are so hypocritical, I swear. They all use the ""my body, my choice"" argument to support transgender people(and more others, but this was the first that came into my mind), yet they fail to acknowledge that this principle works exactly the same for suicidal people. I never asked for this. If(well, obviously hypothetically speaking) I could have gotten a choice whether to be born or not, I might have just said no, so I should have a right to end my miserable existence whenever the hell I want. After all, I have a RIGHT to live, not an obligation to do so. Huge difference.

*edit*: In all fairness, I have to admit that there are situations in which suicide is kind of a dick move. For example, if you have children which still depend on you, killing yourself would more or less ruin their future. So yes, in that case, I disagree with suicide. However, I'm single and I don't have any kids(or any other person whose life depends on me other than myself), so offing myself would not affect anyone in the end."

Last Thursday, my son Alex took his own life. He left no note and there was no indication of his intention to do this. Our family came together in this great sorrow.

I would like people to take away light from this event. Alex was 25. He was a beautiful and kind person that knew how to give but had difficulty in receiving.

We, all of us question what more we could have done to bring more love into his life, but we have no answers and we feel a profound sorrow at the loss of  this beautiful man.

Please, I ask that anyone just please take a breath if this is your contemplation and know that you are loved even if in your moment of despair in that dark place. Please find that you are love and that you have love to give in this world. There are still people, perhaps some you have not even met yet that need your love in their own life.

Know you are light and you shine farther than you yourself may be able to perceive. Know this. Take that breath. Find your peace in the love you have and the love you get.

It's me. I need help. The suicide hotline has been useless. I owe thousands of dollars.
I have been stabbed in the back by yet another person, worked fifty+ hours and got paid nothing and now I'm going to screw my best friend with no rent payment this month, or money for anything else.
But who gives a shit about money. Sure, I made a mistake working two months for no pay with someone else and am now screwed. (Different than above) Sure, the person I trusted most as a friend I just found out has been ripping me behind my back because she thinks I'm in love with her. 

The person I AM in love with, my ex-wife, has moved on, despite the fact that she promised a second chance after I took some time to fix myself and my problems. 

I have no job. No one. My family is utterly miserable and just judges everything that I do. I am 28 and cannot even afford the healthcare I need to take care of my MS, my collapsed ankles and my ADD which keeps me from focusing on anything. My hand is shaking like mad and I'm doing what I can to avoid painkillers.

I know it's completely stupid, but I find it hard to believe I'll ever find anyone who will love me as much as the two people I've screwed over. I'm out of options and pretty sure I'm at my limits.

I never went to Europe, never even went to the East Coast. If I believed in reincarnation or religion, I'd probably not be as worried, but at this point, I've got nothing left.

The suicide hotline was useless, my therapist is an idiot and I can't afford her anymore anyways, my friends are clueless and I'm out of options. Reddit is my last hope to maybe find someone to help me out.

I don't have either of those and I do envy those who are spoiled. My life isn't bad at all and in fact I have many more advantages than most people my age, but I still feel like theres no purpose. I get a degree from university. So what? then I have to work a boring ass fucking office job for years 8 hours a day only having some time on the weekends for a few hours? What is the fucking point.

Overall I honestly feel like theres no purpose in life. Like when thinking about killing myself I try to remember to before I was born and what it was like and I realize I can't remember anything because I didn't exist. It was like a void. The same will happen when I kill myself. no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans can't even comphrend.

I don't know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me, they have goals and are doing stuff. I have no goals. I have no ambitions and don't care what anyone else thinks. One day I will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy. fml.

I don't have any friends or a social circle (literally zero friends or family). I've been trying to go out at night - maybe I can meet another girl the way I met my girlfriend.  Maybe I can stay alive.

I got downtown and started walking over towards the bars. That's when I saw something approaching me.  It was a huge group of people, running with flashing lights and all wearing the same shirts.   It's like they were running a marathon.

I asked someone what was going on, and that's when I saw their shirt.  It said ""one night.  One goal.  Stop suicide.""

They explained to me that it was a charity run to raise money for suicide prevention.  Is this not just a sign of something?  This is the darkest period of my life, and I've been through some shit.

My childhood best friend hasn't chatted with me in years and the only encounters we have are extremely awkward and unpleasant.

My classmates show me pity sometimes, but jump out of the train whenever I try to communicate with them like normal people.

I'm sick and tired of 'behaving myself' so others would be happy that I don't cause any trouble.

I pray every single day I get cancer so at least somebody (doctors) would care about me for a bit before I finally die. Sometimes I dream of losing a limb, or ending up in a wheelchair, but I just don't care. If that happened I would no longer have to try to pretend to be useful.

In 2016 I was raped. It was the hardest time in my life, and I attempted suicide then. Clearly I survived and am still here. 
Tonight I just found out that the girl who I’ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me. 
And yes she knows he raped me. She is very aware of the fact. 
It turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault.  And they are now engaged. She’s somehow kept it a secret from me (I’ve moved away for college so we don’t see each other every day like we used to) but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so I saw a post of the two of them together in Facebook. 
This is the girl who calls me her sister, says she loves me more than anyone, tells me she’ll always be there for me. 

So it hit me tonight. No one actually fucking cares about me. Clearly not. The person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life. 
I feel like it’s 2016 all over again. I feel like all progress I’ve made is lost and I’m back right where I was. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning. I don’t know how to pretend everything’s fine anymore. "

I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication.

TRIGGER WARNING. ⚠️ Trigger Warning ⚠️ 
Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.

I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.

Now comes the awfulness.

Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

- - - - - 

“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.

And then this.

Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.

That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.

That’s when things got worse. 

Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.

Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. 

The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.

Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. 

Just 5 minutes.

The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. 

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

My little brother is an absolute mess. The news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened, swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment. Horrible sick people. Someone said something about publishing this in the paper, and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy. Everyone is hysterical. 

The police have already ruled it a Murder/Suicide. 

My little brother Mike is a mess, my mom is a mess, and I’m trying so hard to be strong. Mike can’t understand why his father would do that. Why he’d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself....taking the cowards way out. The suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body. 

Luckily, Mike’s older brother Bill, the girlfriend Megan, and little Eli is okay. But we are all damaged. How will anything ever be okay again? 

This is SENSELESS.

I’ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family. Now I’m collapsed at my fiancé’s, just taking it all in while he holds me tight. I’ve already put an email in to my therapist. Sorry about the crappy writing, and if this is difficult to understand; it’s a complicated situation and I’m barely functioning.


- - - - - -

EDIT: The news story is out and apparently Rachel survived. She coded and died en route to the hospital, but apparently they eventually got her back. She’s alive, but in critical condition."

I asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it, and they said ""I kept hearing how selfish I was being, and I hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more. I only pulled back when they stopped saying that, (a doctor) told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue, and I felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did, and he knew it wasn't selfishness to me...""

We’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. He attempted suicide once, before we met. I should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. He’s been honest since we met about his mental health and I knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but I was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. 
Fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) He wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. We’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. This Past Fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. He was really down for a few months.  Finally we tried a Ketamine infusion series which worked really well. But slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. We tried a Ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.
He told me last night that he’s done fighting. Life is just too hard. 
I felt like in the fall I had started preparing myself for the fact that I might lose him. I was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. But right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. 
No one else really knows the extent of His depression. I feel selfish wanting him to stay, because I know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. However the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and I have to think about those things because I will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their Dad. And I cannot imagine life without my soul mate. I don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I feel so scared and alone.

** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. This is my first post and first I thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how I was feeling. 

I know it sounds like I’m giving up, but truly I will fight with him as long as he wants. He knows this. He also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. Depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (In my opinion) 

So I’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. 

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. Working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. He’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! 

And we have a beautiful family. We have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. They know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. My kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. 

And for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know I hear you. Keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but I am proof, it’s possible."

Even if there was a mandatory period of therapy or anti depressants etc before.
At one point there’s just little that seems worth trying, and it doesn’t seem fair to try and force people to live.

Life is just shitty for some of us.

I get that the idea is a suicidal person could always get better, but then lots of people don’t recover. And lots of people then have to take it into their own hands.

Sure there’s a lucky few who achieve a peaceful death.

But then what about everyone who spends their final moments suffering, or those who are permanently damaged from botched suicide attempts?

I think the most peaceful method of death in my country would have to be gas. But then one simple mistake and you’re brain damaged for the rest of your life. Incapable of doing anything to take control of your life anymore.

I never wanted to exist. I want to die. There isn't anything in this world that's going to change my mind. I don't want to get better. My mental and physical illness might actually be curable but I don't want to get better. I never enjoyed life and the only reason I am alive is simply due to my parents' selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me. I never asked to be born and no, life isn't a 'gift'. Life is pain, misery and dread.

I am too much of a coward man. I tried to take my life once but didn't do any research on my method so obviously, as you can see, I failed tremendously. I took a bunch of Xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping they'll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing...a simple google search would've saved me some time, because you need HUGE amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die...yet I went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it.

I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit. I wish I had the courage to attempt it again, in a different way, but I'm too much of a pussy. That failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that I'm such a failure that I can't even kill myself. I've been researching suicide methods ever since, but I just can't bring myself to do it, yet I somehow will. I need to.

&amp;nbsp;

Looked up every single suicide method. Most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable. Others, will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and I just don't have the guts to go for it. I am a huge coward. Who knows, maybe I'm just not ready to kill myself yet, as much as I want it??? Possibly.

Jumping in front of a train? Nope, there's a chance of living through it and suffering 100 times more. Jumping off a building? Literally same. If you're unlucky, you can jump off a skyscraper and survive (there's an actual story of some dude who fell off a 47-floor building and survived). Shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since I live in a shithole of a country in Eastern Europe, it's nearly impossible for me to get a gun. I'm currently doing some research on hanging since it's the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and I've read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly. But if you miscalculate, you will either end up decapitated or you'll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you 15 minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging. Overdosing on pills? I can't think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you.

So what am I left with? Oh yes, opiates. Good old heroin. There's stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ODs and said that it was absolute bliss. You just go in a deep sleep and (hopefully) don't wake up. No hallucinations or paranoia or shit that you'd experience with other types of drugs. Just peace. 


&amp;nbsp;

So I started to look for a heroin plug in my area. It's not easy living in a small city because you're out of luck. At some point, I was so desperate that I stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and I just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area. I was met with surprised reactions, some were weirded out, some were concerned. Luckily, I'm not in prison so lucky me I guess, would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something. Long story short, I couldn't find a dealer for the love of me. So here I am, browsing the darknet.

It took me a few weeks to learn the ropes. There's special software like Tails, Tor, PGP/Kleopatra, and the bitcoin wallet of choice. Still, no one will actually guarantee that you don't get scammed. I'm still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that I won't get in trouble. It fucking sucks. I just want to die and I can't understand all the unnecessary struggle I need to undergo. I wish it were as simple as going to the hospital, signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot. Yet, only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows. I didn't choose to come into this life so why am I forced to stay?

I can't find anyone who is willing to fucking help. I have tried reaching out online, both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback I've received was from people who ""want me to get better"". Why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life? Why does everyone care about a random stranger's death so much? I don't want to live, is it a crime to hate life? It certainly seems so.

&amp;nbsp;

There's so much stuff I'm going to risk. I thing I have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback. I'm going to order from him as soon as I figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency. I might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door, who knows? Maybe my pack will get seized. I might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws. Even if I DO get my hands on heroin, I know nothing about it. I don't know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation. Can you freaking believe it? You're trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm. Amazing. I know nothing about how to cook the heroin, how to shoot it up and how much to take. I know nothing about the purity of heroin and I might end up with some shit grade heroin that isn't going to kill me anyway. There's no fucking way to die peacefully. But anyway, I'll go through this. Not sure why I even wrote this, just needed to vent I guess.

&amp;nbsp;

Wish me luck."

I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option. **Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you."

Husband hates and resents me. I’m alone and scared to death A quick explanation of my (37/F) sudden disability: I was a completely healthy, active adult. A few months ago I woke up in the morning, and the muscles all throughout my body had stopped working properly (so weak they shake). I’ve been getting worse by the week and nobody can figure out what’s wrong with me. I’m in constant terrible pain all over and I’ve gotten so frail I’m nearly bed bound. Medication isnt helping the pain or weakness. Can’t care for myself hardly at all now. 

My husband is barely taking care of things that need to be done (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc). He just sits and games on his computer. If I mention that chores aren’t being done he starts screaming at me until I’m afraid he’s going to hit me.

It happened again today. He didn’t put laundry away, and I can’t dig through the pile to get what I need. He had just been gaming all day instead of doing chores. I’m too weak to tell the whole story but I wound up in a very unsanitary and embarrassing situation because of it. When I brought up the situation with him, he went berserk. I managed to get to my car and leave the house. But I don’t have a coat and it’s 36 degrees out. I have nowhere to go. I’m estranged from my parents due to physical abuse. And my friends have slowly abandoned me over the last few months. I’m completely alone now. I’m in so much pain I want to kill myself. And knowing I’m an unwanted burden who is doomed to a life of neglect and resentment makes me positive I should do it. I have nothing, can’t take care of myself, and I don’t belong anywhere because I’m useless. I don’t know what to do beside figure out a way to end it all. How did this happen to me..

 
EDIT: I managed to drive about 3 miles away and I’m hiding in a parking lot so he can’t find me and hurt me. I’m cold because I have no coat and no idea how to get one since stores are packed due to the holidays and I’m not strong enough to even walk to the door anyway. I’m hungry. Shaking all over from pain and fear. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even think of a way I’d be able to kill myself because I’m too weak. Why is life so cruel"

There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time."

I had my daughter at 19. Her father died from cancer when she was 10 months old. I fell into deep depression and wanted to commit suicide. But I convinced myself to keep living until my daughter turned 18. I had nothing at the time, but I was determined to give her the best life until then.

I am now 33. And in those 14 years, I worked my ass off. I was working 2 jobs, while also attending college. I eventually graduated and landed a job that pay well. After a few years I saved up enough money to buy a house. I even put money aside for her college fund. So by the time she turn 18, I would have saved enough money for her to attend a University. Despite all the struggles and barriers I faced, I finally felt content. All my hard work was finally paying off. I started to feel like life was worth living. The thoughts of committing suicide after she turned 18 began to fade.

But now that feeling of self worth is gone and depression has fully taken over again. Everything changed when my daughter turned 14. I found out that she has been sneaking out, having sex, and has been using DXM to get high. My daughter said that she became this way because...of me. Because I was too strict on her with her grades and chores. And that she just wanted to be free. I admit that I do yell at her when she slips up, and that I can be very intense. But I have never lay a hand on her. I grew up in an abusive household, so I told myself I will never hurt her the same way my parents hurt me. I told myself I will raise her the best way that I can. But I failed. I failed as her mother and I was wrong thinking I deserved to live.

I tried putting my daughter in therapy in attempt to help her. She told me she wanted to change. But it was all lies. I still found pills in her room. I even found out that she has a “trap phone”, a secret cellphone she bought from a friend with her birthday money. And she was still sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with boys to have sex. I feel like I completely lost her and she would be happier if I was dead. I feel useless. I feel unnecessary. I feel like I’m not good enough to be her mom. My heart hurts so much. I’m just not strong enough to handle this. I just want this all to end."

Since I started planning this trip, my intent had been to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at some point during my stay. I was not planning on returning to my home country. 

I went to the bridge on the second day to scout it out. High barriers and nets prevent jumping off the ends of the bridge with land underneath, but a 4-foot guardrail is the only thing that prevents jumping off the middle of the bridge. I could have done it right then but it was the middle of the day and I was with a friend; really didn’t want to scar anybody. 

So instead, I went back last night around 8pm. I hung around near the welcome center preparing myself for a few minutes, then approached the pedestrian walkway. What I hadn’t predicted was the walkway being closed to pedestrian access at 6:30pm! I was way too afraid of getting caught by the cameras or patrol guards while sneaking over the barrier, so I headed back home and make a plan to return. 

My flight back home was at 6:30am, so I planned to leave my host’s house around 4:30am pretending to go to the airport, but actually going back to the bridge which opened at 5am for pedestrians. I set my alarm-clock for 4am and went to sleep. 

I woke up needing to pee around 2am, and the
full weight of what I was planning to do suddenly hit me. I started having major doubts about the plan working, worried about somehow surviving, chickening out while on the bridge but then missing my flight and getting stuck here, or the patrol people catching me and certifying me under a 5150. That would mean missing my flight, a huuuge medical bill since I don’t have US insurance, and a massive freak out from my family. 

So, after considering all of those factors, I cancelled the taxi I had booked for the GGB and rebooked a new one for the airport. I’m here now waiting to get on the plane. 

Moral of the story: I never thought things like barriers or nets or patrols would deter people, but I guess it worked on me. This would have been my seventh and probably final attempt, the other 6 including overdoses that ended in multi-day comas, slashing my wrists, and starving myself. I’m sure I’ll try again in the near future but for now I’m safe, so thanks, GGB, for that. I guess.  "

Sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. I just felt like I needed to share with someone. Since it was the topic of suicide I figured this was the place to post it.

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them.

I can’t do that to our families. It’s my fault for not knowing he’d do this, his family didn’t even know he was depressed but I knew. And I never thought anything like this would happen. I need him back. I can’t go on anymore. There’s so much pain in my body. Every night when I lay down I feel the pressure around my neck and I just want it to end. I’m too scared to hang myself like that. I just want to slip away peacefully. I just want as many pills as I can take and go somewhere where my family won’t find me before the police. I’ll leave a note, unlike him. I’ll give people answers. He took all of my answers away from me. The only answer I have from him is to go with him. I don’t know why he’d do this to us. I feel him slipping away. He’s my soulmate. I don’t know what to do. I’m waiting for him to tell me if I should do it, but he’s not answering me. I don’t want to be here without him. I just can’t do it. I’m not strong enough without him. "

I wasn't the closest to him but if I needed him he would've driven the 4+ hours away he lived from me to come help. 

He had the biggest heart.

Now he is dead at 27. Nobody is talking about it on his facebook (he only had 70~ facebook friends, but that's the kind of guy he was). 

His closest friends were my boyfriend and two of my boyfriends other friends. His funeral is on Sunday on the 31st but he doesn't get a proper funeral. There is no burial. I am pretty sure the extent of his death being honoured will be it mentioned on mass on the 31st, but not with a single brochure. 

HE WAS AN AMAZING PERSON. Literally one of the kindest hearts, and he is barely getting acknowledged and it is driving me nuts. I know that those who loved him and were close to him are acknowledging him in their hearts everyday but it is just pissing me off that nobody is talking about him.

He was thrown too much shit in life and was not given the chance to flourish. 

I just wanted to let the world know that they lost someone really amazing this month."

I am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give. I just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before I die tonight. Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. I just couldn't get her out of my mind. That Christmas she introduced me to her family and I saw what a real family is for the first time. Loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. The next year was like a dream. She took me to Europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. The second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. I was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. I trusted only her. By the time exams came around I was in such a terrible state I turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. I did that and tried to get better. I tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. I was in my twenties and had never had a job, I felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

I returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. The only reason I graduated was that I chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as I knew one exam would be too much pressure. Instead I had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

I was so lost and embarrassed in life, I had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. I deleted almost everyone from social media because I couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. Once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the US. Again, it was incredible. I asked her why the hell she was with me. She told me I was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together I would finally be able to build the confidence I needed to succeed. She truly believed in me after all that time. I asked her to marry me. She said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as I had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. She graduated in August and we moved in together in September. She started working at a nearby hospital and I went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. I planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. From September 1st to November 1st this year I no longer had depression. I was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. I was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. Then she left me. She knew everything I'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. I travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

She has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. These last two months have been insufferable. We still sleep in the same bed. All I wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that I'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights I can't help but beg. She has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. She says I'm not a real man, I'm not funny, I'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. I guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and I made her laugh all the time. She doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and I have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but I can't afford to live anywhere else and I can't go back to my mum's house. It's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. She says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. They are *my* family too at this point but I'm not allowed near the house. Her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. I haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. Now I have to go and spend Christmas with a family I thought I'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years. Fuck that. I simply will not do this anymore. I cannot spend another day in this horrible fucking world."

I told my only best ""friend"" what happened to me and suddenly the whole school found out. I attacked her for it, injured her badly and ended up in a teen jail (we have that in germany, not sure if that exists elsewhere). After a few months there the guards started to sexually abuse me as well. I left my body at this point and wasn't really there anymore mentally. 

After all this, life finally looked good for me, i started a job and had my own apartment and i thought it gets better. But apparently one of my old highschool classmates then black mailed me, threatening to tell my boss about my past. I begged him not to do it, and he asked me for sex or he will leak the information. I had to oblige and took his abuse to keep my job. Police never believed me because i had no evidence. He blackmailed me in person, not digitally. I couldn't prove it. After 1 year of being his sextoy, he still leaked the info.

I got fired today and am now homeless. I am literally using my last phone battery to type this down. I have nowhere to go now. The women's help organization disapproved of me as well because i was in jail once.

People talk about how hurt they are or how confused...that they never saw it coming...others encourage them by saying that no one could have stopped it or that no one would've known that the suicidal person was in pain during their time on earth. People spend so much time making their suicide about them that they forget that they could have done something about it..that they could have reached out to the person before it was too late. 

It makes me sick. People post on social media about how heart broken they are, add their 'thoughts and prayers are with their family' bull crap, a few hashtags and boom. They're absolved of all guilt and pain and go on with their lives. I hate society. I hate the way people make tragedy about themselves and then go on with their life. I refuse to live in a world where a person could feel so helpless, so lonely, so depressed, so troubled, that they take their life...only to be left behind by people that don't think of a solution to prevent suicide, but rather about how hurt they are and how much it has affected them. What about the pain that you may have contributed to this persons life? Everyone acts as if it isn't a preventable thing when it is. Oh, well.

In other words. I'm done living in a world overflowing with so much ego. I'd rather be dead. Goodbye cruel world."

When i cried as a child they'd tell me to man up or that men don't cry. and from there i never got a tear out. no matter how much of a mental wreck i was. i always absorbed the damage and kept it inside.  The weight  is heavy on my chest. 

I always was enslaved by my manipulative brother. ont day when he stole something  that i loved i chocked the shit out of him. they forced me to apologize.  And another time where he false accused me of something. i was mad i tried to stab the shit out of him. i got sent to my room. i cried and when my dad tried talking to me  he said that we don't  need your problems too
I've gone out and thought of suicide

Then i stopped myself  because  the only person i cared about (my mother) would be sad. I may be suicidal but I'm  a man of dedication  and a strong mentality and
  i promised that no harm should be donne to her

Like I've been programmed to suffer perpetually and eventually kill myself. alt account because people I know, know my main account username.

hello reddit.
I would really like to die, because it seems like the optimist in me is completely dead. And that's a good thing, because I can't count the number of times I've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go ""Just wait a little bit longer. You'll be happy someday"". I would like to kill myself, because yes, I'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. I try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. Let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. Before I ask you guys what I want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. There's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.

I've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. It's been rough, and what sucks is just the country I live in, which I'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. It's India. Everyone here is a giant piece of shit. Everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. Doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. What makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation I get from coworkers from my full time job (I don't have friends to depend on). It's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. I don't think I can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimes

The worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time I'm suicidal). When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.

So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.


Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry if I sound angry, or like a shit person or something."

She had already gone to sleep and I was slowly drifting off until I got a call. The name was ""Papa"". I immediately woke up. My heart fucking burst and before I even accepted the call I started bawling. I say hello and I hear his voice ""Is your mom home? Can you bring her the phone I couldn't get ahold of her."" I rush down the stairs unable to see from the tears and wake mom up and hand her the phone saying it's papa. She wakes up instantly and says ""God please no"" I start crying even harder. The first words my grandpa says is ""Mom's going right now"" at that I collapsed into the fetal position and lost it. 

I can't take this. This is more painful than anything I've experienced. The cutting, the pain I felt before attempting suicide in the past, the abuse. Nothing hurts more than losing 1 of the only two people who made me feel like I mattered.

read made far,1,"My husband died, I'm left with 6 kids 3 of which are my neice and nephews who are survivors of sexual assault. I don't want to do this anymore. This is going to be an extremely long post,and some of this information may seem irrelevant but it all ties together why I just don't want to carry on in this world anymore, so if you make it to the end I'm grateful you read my story. I grew up in a very emotionally abusive household with a schizophrenic mother and a narcissistic father, but I overcame the years of abusive relationships with abusive men and finally found true love in 2007 

  As the title states my husband of ten years passed away from cancer in August, just 3 days after our ten year Anniversary. He fought cancer for a good 2 years but everything happened so quickly. I was his caregiver up until hospice got involved the last 3 weeks of his life. Even at that point I did 90 percent of the work. I'm absolutely traumatized by seeing him waste away, I won't go into too many details because it makes me physically ill to remember him that way, but his tumors were wrapped around his corroded artery and he had a trach tube and a feeding tube. He couldn't speak because the tumors were everywhere in his mouth, so he had to use that stupid text to speech. 

 At this point we had our 3 children ages 2, 9, and 7.
We also had custody of a neice aged 13 and a nephew aged 15. We had them for about 7 years, due to my neice telling me during a visit that her babysitters were sexually assaulting her. I did contact social services in the county they were living in and the 3 other children were interviewed but lied and said there was no abuse. They had already been removed from the home and in foster  care for two years, but my brother and his wife were given back custody. They were scared and threatened every day, and their mother was also physically abusing them and their father too.  In hindsight I should've done more to pursue this family of molesters. When I told social services they said now that my neice was in another county it wasn't worth reporting it and because it would be traumatic to my neice to be interviewed. I have a tremendous amount of guilt for not telling them to fuck off and calling the cops. As the saying goes; hindsight is 20/20. Several months later my brother left his emotionally and physically abusive wife (mind you I was still unaware and very much in denial about his part in this). They all came and stayed with us, my brother and his 3 other children. I found out months later after giving my brother a free place to live he was speaking and visiting his abusive wife the entire time. Once asked to leave he ended up taking his younger two boys and leaving his oldest son with us. I'm kind of unsure why that was the case, but that's what happened. 

My neice went through rough times, lots of bed wetting and attention seeking behavior. She was also extremely mean to my daughter who would've been 3 at the time. I feel like she learned to start problems with people and play victim because that's what her mom did. So many unhealthy behaviors that rubbed off on my daughter. I should have gotten her into therapy right away, but I guess I kind of thought she had talked to me about it and kind of moved on. 

My nephew has always been pretty well behaved, and had some anger twords me for not swooping in earlier to save him. He has always completely shut down when it comes to any sort of emotions. He's a very good kid in general but definitely angry.  Again we had to try and help them unlearn this learned behavior. The swearing and the threats of killing people. 

Fast forward to 2017 when my husband was diagnosed with his cancer. Again, I just can't go into too many details because it's still too painful. It was a solid two years without any intimacy and again me being his caregiver not his wife. It was okay though, all of it because I had something people only dream about. True, unconditional fucking love. I would do it a million times over if I had too. Again though, I have so much guilt for not spending more time with him, but there were 5 kids that needed to be cared for. Slowly all the kids drifted farther and farther away from dad, because I think it was too scary for them to see. The only one who didn't was the youngest, she didn't see cancer guy, she just saw dad. I think she kind of got him through the really, really tough times.  

After my husband passed away, I was not invited to partake in the writing of his eulogy by his family, because according to his mother, I was in no state to contribute, was I? I was really shoved aside by his parents and aunts, but more specifically his mother. To this day she doesn't call or try to see her grandkids, the only remnants of her son. It breaks my fucking heart to see this, I'd be fine never seeing her again, but wtf why don't you see the kids? My husband was a man of very strong faith, and very selfless so he knew he was going to a better place and he felt terrible that he was going to have to leave us. All the children also go to a private school, which now I'm very grateful for. At the visitation and the funeral the kids went right up to him and touched him and said ""daddy's not even in there anymore, he's in heaven."" As someone who struggles with faith, I'm okay with this. The little kids need that faith right now. 

Fast forward about 5 months and my nephew Sean comes for a sleepover, it's Christmas break, so he keeps asking every night if he can sleep over. Alright dude, that's cool, but what's up? Why don't you want to go home? Turns out both parents are physically abusing him, and the emotional abuse every day all day is enough to break the strongest of people. Alright, I'm calling your dad, I will do whatever it takes to keep this kid safe. Throughout all this my brother who's been tn the methadone program for several years finds his wife has been shooting meth for 6 months but hadn't noticed? Things were okay, Sean is openly gay which is fine with me but he also has an extremely foul mouth which I've had to reign in constantly.  Now there's this strange shift in my nieces behavior, and by now she's been in therapy for several months because she said she was suicidal. But it's a really bad shift in her. She's even more spiteful and bitchy and mean to the little kids. And her and Sean are trying to share a room, and I say absolutely not. I sense a very unhealthy connection between those two. A strange co dependency I've never before seen. 

Over this time my neice Kailey decides to come out to me as gay. Okay, that's fine. But are you gay or are you wanting to fit in or get attention. I apologize if that statement offends anyone but I know her and this is the polar opposite of her normal boy crazy behavior. My oldest nephew has been lost in all of this drama between Kailey and Sean. They fight eachother, Kailey beats up all the little kids and is frankly out of control with her behavior. I think Sean coming here has triggered something in her. Something very unhealthy. I believe that not only were her and Sean made to perform sexual acts on these male and female babysitters but also on eachother. I don't know what to do. They must be carrying around a huge weight of shame even though it isn't their fault. My goal is to get Sean into therapy so we can figure some of this out. 

I feel like I've failed my children. Everyone says they need structure, but wtf does that look like when there's six of them and one of me. I have realized every single one of them take advantage of and are very rude to me. I'm tired, tired of missing my husband, tired of going through the motions but just wanting to not be here anymore. I resent mostly my neice for coming here and really affecting my children's behavior in a negative way. I resent my husband for leaving me all alone. I resent my own children because I have to stay on this fucking earth because they need me. I often fantasize how I would die. I wouldn't want them to find me because it would be awful for them. I think about hanging and the second before I kick that stool out I text my friend telling her to get the kids from school and that I'm ending it all. My oldest nephew completely shuts down and won't say a word. His anger is real, one day he pushed me so hard I fell and hit my head very hard. His guilt and shame was immediately apparent. But the realization was holy shit, this kid could beat the shit out of me. I'm working on getting everyone else in therapy (my two nephews and my daughter). My son has been going since before his dad died because he has childhood anxiety and depression and hdhd. 

I'm not a nice mother, I yell and I swear and I ask them wtf is wrong with them for them to act this way. I do feel like as much as they love me, they would be better off without me. They always worry about me, and I would like them to not bear that burden. Every morning I wake up with more and more anxiety, I take .5 mg kolonopin to help  slow down my mind. Sometimes I think I'm just not meant for this world, there's just too much pain and the monotony of every day doesn't help. I'm absolutely lost. Every day the urge to die is stronger. I'm not even afraid anymore. The last few weeks I have truly realized how terrible things are. How awful the kids treat eachother and treat me, how they don't even hear my yelling anymore. How I'm cleaning up after everyone, everyday because nobody helps me. It's like, at first the kids were what got me through and kept me going, but now I feel like anger and sadness is just hurting them. I feel ready to die, but for now I'm going to leave it  in the cruel hands of fate. I'm aware I need help, but there's no time for it. I'm too busy trying to keep these kids from killing eachother and trying to not kill myself. Idk if this was the right place to share my story, but I figured because my want to die is so strong maybe this would be the place. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

My name is Rob, and I have a life changing favor to ask. 

I have debated on making this post numerous times. However I always made an excuse to back out. I’m not sure if this is allowed here, and if it isn’t, I’m truly sorry, but this seems to be the place where I can speak directly with the kinds of people that this message is aimed at. 

This will be an extremely personal look into mental health, and the side effects of said illnesses, but this is the last shot I could come up with. Ok... with all that being said.... 

I have been medically diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Ranging from multiple personalities, to extreme anxiety, and depression. I had a physically, sexually, and mentally abused upbringing. Videogames have always been an escape for me. They used to help me out tremendously with my social disorders... I used to talk to strangers all around the world. I played Socom on PS2, Rainbow Six 3 on PC, and a ton of Xbox Live on the original Xbox.. mostly Pandora Tomorrow’s multiplayer. 

However... as years went on. I started to distance myself from any and all social happenings. Even if I had friends online I would always “go offline” to hide. On Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PS4 I always just put myself into a private party so I can’t hear anyone. 

After this went on for almost a decade... I finally decided it was time to end my life. I had done nothing for society, and I always ran from people even if they tried to help. However, this attempt would prove unsuccessful, as the belt around my neck broke before I had fully succumbed. 

I don’t have hardly any family left, or a single friend. I understand it’s my fault entirely. However... today, I’m wanting to make a positive change in my life for once. 

As someone who doesn’t get out and is scared to talk to people.. you can imagine how difficult it is to make friends. 

However, I started thinking, “the internet has millions of people... maybe this message would reach a person and we would start a meaningful friendship”.  That was my thought process behind this whole post anyway. 

Why post it here, you may ask? 

Well.... Videogames are *literally* the only thing I know. I have followed this industry my whole life. It’s the only thing I know how to talk about. So I figured... if I was to make a friend, what better place to look then on the internet ^.^

In closing: if there is a kind soul out there that would be willing to be patient and understanding with me and start slow (IE: text messaging, over voice at first) it would mean the absolute world to me. 

Thank you all so much for reading. 

❤️ you all

Yet, whenever things get difficult, my mind always turns to suicide. Every time.

I don’t necessarily want to die, because I want to fulfill my dreams (which are really basic...traveling more, making a lifelong friend group, finding love, etc etc) but things just get so difficult and I wonder if my dreams are worth all this suffering."

I’m just done. title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been depressed since I was a child, have wanted to kill myself for the past decade. I’ve always felt like something was just “missing” in my brain. I’ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and fucked up pretty much every friendship I’ve ever had. I’ve gone to therapy, been on meds, was institutionalized a couple times. Nothing helps.

It’s not that I don’t love life, because I think it’s wonderful and grand. I’ve traveled a lot, and done so much. I genuinely love myself and I love painting and hiking and film and so much in life.. But I just am so tired. I’ve wanted to die for so long. And then two months ago, the love of my life killed himself. We were supposed to get married. He was the only person that I ever had any sort of connection with. He was so unbelievably wonderful and kind and I miss and love him so much. The past two months have been truly, truly horrible. I never thought I could feel so much pain. I’ve had a countless amount of horrible, sad nights due to my mental illness but none even compare. I bought heroin to kill myself. I’ve never done it, so I have no tolerance so mixing that and a few beers will surely do the job. It’s also how my boyfriend died (not an addict, but bought it to kill himself).

I’m driving across the country tomorrow. My family thinks I’m starting a new job (which I do have one lined up that I accepted as a “just in case”), but I’m really just going to travel for a couple more days, see some art museums, go on a hike, and then finally do it. Part of me is scared, but I can’t go on like this anymore. Each day has somehow gotten worse since my boyfriend died, and it’s absolutely unbearable.  I tried to kill myself a month ago and just ended up in a mental hospital that only made things worse. I’m sad about thinking about dying, but only because I’m sad that it can’t end up any other way. Both of my parents have life long mental illnesses that don’t go away, and I have no desire to end up like that. Anyway, I just wanted to tell someone. I’m a really open person, and it’s hard to not talk about this with anyone. Everyone around me knows I’m suicidal (obviously, since I was just in the hospital), but no one knows I have another plan.

Last night I went and bought 20 8mg dilaudid pills crushed them up put them into a needle and shot it into my arm. I had about 10 seconds where I thought should I call 911 do I really want this, and than everything faded. I woke up 10 hours later with 30 missed calls from my parents , ex girlfriend and my only friend.

I felt shame and embarrassment this morning , I wasn’t looking for attention . I just wanted my physical and mental pain to end.
But I’m not feeling shame tonight , I feel lucky to be alive, and thankful to those who care about me. Anyone contemplating suicide , ask someone to talk call a friend, fuck go to a hospital. I love you all , and I hope anyone going thru shit, will get thru it.

Sure, I could call a suicide hotline, but all they would do is send the police to my house, who would arrest me and take me to the hospital. So super, then I'd have the traumatizing experience of being put in handcuffs for being depressed and a hospital bill I can't afford that would eventually be sent to collections and wreck my credit. I'd still be physically alive but still no closer to fixing my mental health and all of the awful life circumstances causing my depression in the first place.

I don't know what to do. I have no one and nothing. I had some things to look forward to about a year ago, but those fell apart, and now I have truly nothing. I know I'm not being specific, but I don't have the energy to type out a really long story, and it won't matter anyway. Truthfully the only argument I have against dying is that it would kill my dog if I was suddenly gone. Earlier today, she ran away, and while I was outside looking for her, the thought that kept running through my head is, ""What if she's dead. What if a car hit her or she went swimming in the creek and an alligator ate her? Then I'd truly have no reason left to be alive."" This is what my life has come to. Nonstop thoughts like this.

I want to go to a therapist so bad, but I can't afford it. Don't tell me that there are therapists who will reduce their fees or that there are free clinics. A) It doesn't matter how much the therapist reduces their fee if I have ZERO MONEY, and B) Free clinics do not exist in my area. At all. I've researched extensively, and they just aren't a thing. I say this because every time I've posted about my situation online in the past, I've gotten flooded with people telling me to go find a free clinic or to start calling up therapists and asking if they'll reduce their fees. It's exhausting to try to explain over and over again that those solutions don't work.

Okay, that's all. I had to say something somewhere, and Reddit is free at least."

We've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at SW lately.  You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

&gt; Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.  

Edit: typos, added the origin of ""It Gets Better"".

It's nothing but selfishness and double standards.

You can be complaining about the cruelness and unfairness of the world with someone who agrees and even contributes to the conversation, but the moment you hint at having suicidal ideations their mind suddenly shifts and they go from talking about how the world is awful to it being this beautiful place where you can find hope in any situation. People's minds just suddenly changing like that suggests that they don't truly believe in either. Why should I have faith in your forced words?

It's perfectly okay to strip people of their homes when they're financially struggling, and it's acceptable to shove someone into a corner with little to no solutions, but committing suicide? No, you're not allowed to stop your pain. ""If you're suicidal because of a lack of money, we'll hospitalize you, do jack shit to help you, and then charge an insane amount of money for it."" And when you're released you're expected to be completely fucking cured and to go back to being a mindless, content slave. ""If you don't like being a slave, then fuck you. You can starve, because we're not going to help you. You're not useful to society so you mean absolutely nothing to us. Oh, but... don't kill yourself, because we actually care."" 

Life is shitty from the very beginning. Even as a young kid you're forced to attend school for eight hours a day and have to deal with the stress of tests and exams that determine your classes and if you're able to move forward to the next grade. Fucking 9 year old kids shouldn't have to deal with that kind of pressure. It's incredibly unfair and even as a child I knew that the education system was/is bullshit. But if you don't finish school it just makes the rest of your life even harder. You're never given a break. After or even during school, you're expected to get a job. All of the time you could have had to yourself is just gone. You never have the chance to do anything *you* want to do anymore. People stay up later and get less sleep than they should just so they can have a few hours to themselves before they have to worry about their responsibilities again. And it's a cycle that is just supposed to continue until you're too old to do anything else with your life. It's depressing shit.

Why am I mentally ill for wanting to break out of that cycle? Why are people *not* considered mentally ill for seeing this lifestyle as normal and thinking that it's possible to be happy living like that? Call me weak, lazy, etc. But I just can not mentally or physically handle the responsibilities and stress of life. It's always been too much for me. The world and everyone in it is unbelievably cruel. Situations like the one we're dealing with now just put people's natural selfishness on full display; buying everything before anyone else can, leaving their homes for unimportant reasons, etc. No one cares about anything or anyone else other than themselves. I can't seriously believe anyone who says otherwise. The proof is all around you and it's impossible to ignore.

I'm tired of all of these bullshit ""solutions"". Hospitalizing me and trapping me in a psych ward isn't going to fucking help me. It's counterproductive as shit and is just further proof that medical ""professionals"" don't know anything and lack any sort of empathy. You have to be fucked up to think that locking multiple people with different issues and illnesses together is actually effective and will help anyone. I don't care about your hotline spam and cookie-cutter ""advice"" either. No, it doesn't get better. My life has only gotten harder, and will continue to do so. You don't know me or what I'm dealing with. Stop acting like you know all the solutions to my problems, as doing so just makes you come off as incredibly ignorant. 

I don't want help by pills being shoved down my throat or by countless therapists telling me the same things but worded slightly different. I want out. Out of this life before it can get worse. I'm tired of being a part of this sick game where everyone loses in the end. If you actually cared about me and my happiness and not your own, you'd give me the option of a peaceful rest."

I read doctor's notes for a living, I see the failed attempts. Guns, knives, pills, whatever you could find to hang yourself- nothing is absolutely going to kill you 100% of the time. And with my luck, I know I'll be one of the ones who puts a bullet in their brain and comes out the other side with the mentality of a child. And I am not about to attempt to kill myself, survive unharmed, and deal with all that bullshit fallout.

It's just so fucking hard. All of it is. When I was in elementary school I would tell myself: ""Just make it to middle school and we'll get better.""
Middle school comes, ""Just make it to high school and we'll get better"" 
High school: ""Just make it to college and we'll be better."" College: ""Just graduate and get a job and we'll get better.""

And now I'm graduated and have a job, and I'm still not better. It doesn't get better. All of these things I've told myself over the years are lies. 

I hate myself. I hate my brain. I fucking hate living. I'm not a religious person, but I pray everyday that the cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs will start doing their jobs and finally fucking kill me. Suicide is a constant thought in my mind. It's the white noise of my brain. When I'm falling asleep, I'm thinking of taking my grandfather's gun out of the safe and finally ending it. I imagine it, everyday, all day. I can't remember the last time a day went by when I didn't.

You wanna know the worst part? My life isn't even that bad. I've never been abused or raped or anything traumatic like that. I have a mother who adores me. A husband who would do anything for me. A dog, who has been my best friend for the past 13 years. I make decent money and don't live an extravagant lifestyle or have kids, so I'm not broke. I'm just a gal who's brain is fucked and can't even call a doctor to schedule an appointment without having a goddamn panic attack. It's pathetic, sickening, and a disgrace to the people who actually deal with real problems.

I just really needed to rant. Sorry."

I really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden I've been holding for a while and I just no longer know what to do.

I know y'all are busy, so I've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy I decided to highlight all of the key points:

1. **I feel so lonely**, I've never had a group of friends that I could constantly reach, this has been my life since I was a child. There's plenty of people that know me and people that I can interact with, I'm not an unlikable person but there's no one I have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. Despite this there're people that do talk to me and I've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly I don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.
2. **I have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. Simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. My bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, I feel really guilty about it.
3. In my search for love this past year, I was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** This has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when I began dating him I told everyone about him, I even told my family. He lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later I texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop ""obsessing over him"" and blocked my number that very same day. **I was so embarrassed I didn't told anyone what happened.**
4. I've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **I don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys I would particularly find attractive, however I don't know why I keep doing this.
5. **I have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person I think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. It seems that for people I'm an acceptable target to abuse.
6. I often feel **my ""friends"" just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.
7. **I constantly have suicidal thoughts**, I don't want to be here anymore and I don't understand what's the point of keeping on because I know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. Often times I could be walking near a bridge and in my head I start thinking on how can I ended it all by jumping. I've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.
8. **It's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example I can't open a tab with a YouTube video because I immediately change it.
9. For the last year I've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit I don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money I'm spending it all. I've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and I feel extremely guilty about it.
10. Last year I've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. For example, this week I've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.
11. I'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, I don't like a lot what I do and every time I show someone my work for critiques, I'm mostly met with good critiques, but I feel like they're lying to me. For some reason, deep inside me, I know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.
12. **I have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. Ever since I was little I do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time I dislike the way I'm writing.** This happens in every other aspect of my life. For example, if I don't like how I'm drawing, I rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if I don't like how my phone is organized I delete all the data and I try to reorganize it again, etc.
13. **I have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.
14. Lastly, **I feel ugly as fuck**, I have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately I know I look like a hot mess.

I feel in a state of emergency because this time I have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but I can't possibly move because I don't know what to do. I've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but I feel really weak right now and I don't know if I can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues I have, so maybe they can finally tell me if I have something. I'm desperate because I need a fix for all of this things, I'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.

What is your experience what has worked for y'all?"

I'll have to kill myself in that time WARNING!! Sorry for bad English

I live in Korea with mandatory military service for all boys and I'm gonna kill my life. I'm scared to go to military. I'm in a lot of worrying. I think to myself, what if I waste 2 years of my life that I could have done other things for like college? What if North Korea starts war and I have to fight and be captured and tortured for life? What if my generals and soldiers are super mean and beat me? What if tomorrow is the last day I see my family, since they might die in 2 years I am in military?

I am so sad, scared, and painful. 2 years seems short by number but boys who come out say it's longest 2 years because it's so stressful. I dont want to wake up at 5am and do hard training like crawl in mud and electric wires and toxic gas training. Plus some boys who are bad soldiers are extended time for military.

When I'm young at 10 years, I was so scared too everyday when I learn about mandatory service, and my mother always said: don't worry because when your older the law will change. But it doesn't change, and I'm very close thinking about suicide because it's so scary when I look at the clock and calendar. I have 48 hours and I think very strongly to suicide in the 48 hours. I NEVER think about suicide before but this time I do for first time in my life because of so much pain

EDIT Thank you all you lovely and kind people for comments and PMs. Sadly I can't reply to all, because I want to spend the short time I have doing important things, but I wish I could reply to all. Thank you thank you thank you, it's so good to read and makes me so happy"

 I’ll never get to make stupid mistakes and grow up, bc w every little mistake my parents scream at me and emotionally abuse me, so that’s always made me terrified to do anything that they think is wrong.

My heads fucked. Well and proper. Someone turned my brain into a smoothie, and told a monkey it’s a puzzle to put back together. 

I can’t hear properly. I tune everything out to listen to the pains in my head. How fucked I am, and how much I hate life. 

But wait! There’s more!

I’m loud, obnoxious, and act like I know it all. I don’t like being that person, but it’s inevitable that after knowing people for a while I let that slip. 

But look at the beautiful world arou-

Nope. Worlds so fucked. 9-5 thankless jobs “but go study” study fucking what? So I can get a different kind of 9-5 to chase paper so I can slave out my own existence?

There’s really no good I can see. There’s no help. Psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, they all ghost me. Self help doesn’t work either. I got fit and healthy, didn’t feel anything but worse when I hit that point of being fit and healthy, realising it’s made me no better. 

I don’t do anything anymore. Maybe I’ll get drunk and flick through reddit. I go to work to sell my soul just to go home and sleep 18 hours because I can’t do anything else.

I don't remember most of that day I just remember passing out and then waking up with my pants around my ankles and him behind me and feeling this awful pain. He told me that if I tell anyone he'd kill me, and that I'm special. I sat on the roof for hours crying that night. Then I went back to my bunk and tried to sleep. I thought it was the end but it wasn't. It keeps happening and happening and it never ends. I'm losing focus in school, I don't eat anymore. I ignore everyone and no one cares. He makes me go to the dark room with him every few days to ""help"" him and if I don't he gets mad, I tried not going once and I got f*cked with a cross for it. I couldn't walk straight for a week. Last night was one of the worst nights to date. It was awful. He made me realize how much of a worthless piece of filth I am. Which is why I'm writing this. I'm just done. I'm crying and It hurts that this is what it has come to. I wish someone had saved me. But everyone just stands there and watches, it's so obvious that they know what he does. But nothing. Nothing has changed. I get it now. I just don't deserve to be saved, and I get that now. my name is Matthew and Im 16.

A bit about my son- Before he starting dating his now deceased girlfriend, he was extremely depressed. He broke up with his girlfriend who was his best friend before. That absolutely crushed him. He used to be the happiest kid ever! He hung out with friends and was all around just a happy person. After that happened he became very cold and distant. He hated to go out with family and wanted to be alone.  He mistrusted everyone and even mistrusted his mother, my wife. He claimed that she was a liar and was manipulating me to get him in trouble. HE thought of everyone like that. 

 Anyway a few years ago he meet a girl, who I’ll call Emma, and he did a complete 180. He was happy again and became a better person all around. He always told me how much he loved her. I don’t think Ive ever seen two people in love as him and Emma. She was so ingrained in our family that she started to come to family reunions we would have with our cousins every few months. His depression never really went away though. He went through bouts of being extremely sad, but he always found a way to “plateau” himself. Emma, however, has had it much worst. He told me that she was beaten by her father, and how she had to grow up early because when she, her mother and her sister moved out, her mother became an alcoholic and was unable to take care of them.

She and my son moved into an apartment and have been living together for a little while now. About a month ago he called me on the phone and his voice was very shaky. He told me that she tried to kill herself with his own gun. He told me that he took a week off of work to be with her. He also told me that he was going to talk with some therapists. That takes us to 5 days ago. I got a call from him and he was crying a lot. After about 1 minute or so he finally collected his voice and told me that she had killed herself. He told me that and I got in my car and drove 2 hours to where he lived. When I got there, he was cleaning blood out of the carpet. He stood up and there was still blood on his clothes. I gave him a hug and he starting crying. He kept saying things like: “It was my fault” and “I could have stopped her”. He told me that when they woke up that morning, she wanted a snack, so he went out to get her a snack. When he came back, he found her on the floor with her wrists slit. She was barely alive so he ran to he and tried to help her by putting pressure on her wounds. He said that she died in his arms.

At the funeral when her casket was being lowered, he didn't cry at all, he just stared at it. He had this blank expression on his face. After it was lowered and people were shoveling dirt into the hole, he just started walking away. He walked passed his car and was walking toward the entrance of the cemetery. We called out to him but he continued to walk. I caught up to him and I turned him around and told him that I wanted to help him through what he was going through. He looked coldly and said, “I have nothing to say to you”. He looked like he wasn’t there. I could see it in his eyes. It was as if his body was talking, but he wasn’t. Its hard to explain. He turned away and continued to walk. We later found him wandering aimlessly around town.

 I went to visit him today. Since I'm a cosigner of his apartment I have an extra key.  I found him passed out on his desk and bottle of vodka in his hand. In his other hand I noticed that there was something in his hands. I opened it up and what I saw made me cry. There was a box with a wedding ring. He was going to propose to her! How can I help my son with what he’s going through? I don’t know what to do. I feel like Im not doing enough.

i was molested by my math teacher when i was 13/14 and now every year i just feel like i’m getting uglier and uglier. objectively i am more attractive than i was then but in my head i still feel like i’m undesirable because i’m not a little girl anymore. every birthday is miserable for me. turning 18 was particularly difficult. 

all those feelings came back last night when i stumbled across a subreddit which basically insinuates that women are worthless once they reach a certain age. they claim that women peak at 13-16 and everything is over after that.  seeing how ugly i feel now i’m starting to think it’s true. if i feel like a repulsive old hag at 20 then how will i feel when i’m 25, 30, or 40?

Apologies if this post sounds insensitive, in fact I’m very suicidal and have attempted multiple times, each time met with people who stop and prevent it from succeeding. Also what’s the point of talking to therapists and doctors when you can’t be honest? As soon as you express that you would like to die they lock you up and set you back even further in life. So my original question is how come humans try to stop others from committing suicide when they don’t know what’s really best for the individual? They would never know what it’s been like for the suicidal person throughout every step of their life and what the future holds for them if any. I believe if someone truly wants to die they should have the right and freedom to. Not be locked up in a mental hospital and or forced to confine in everyday life.. on and on every single day is torture and depression from the moment the eyes open till close. The suicidal thoughts never ever leave. So why are you so certain not committing suicide is for the best?"

I got into a car accident on an empty street by my house in the middle of the country. I flipped my car.

I was suicidal. I wanted to die. I wanted to die. All I wished for was for death and I couldn’t get it. I’m in an abusive household and I’d had a major argument with my parent where they called me basically every name in the book for the 300th time that month. I was leaving another dead end job. I wanted to live with my SO, but my SO lived 4k miles away and it felt like the dream of moving there was fading.

I was driving home and I just fucking bawled and screamed about how much I wanted to fucking die. I still don’t know if it happened by accident or on purpose. I didn’t die. I laid in the ditch. I told myself as I crumbled out of the wreckage that I wouldn’t be suicidal anymore. That my parents would care about me. Everyone cared for 2 days before they began screaming at me when I was too afraid to drive. That I’m a burden and that I need to get over it. I’m still terrified to drive but I just force myself to do it.

Nobody cares about me and life is repeating itself. In fact, life is worse than it was before my accident. I don’t even have a dead end job to go to anymore, I just sit and think about how I should have died in that accident. My mom constantly tells me she doesn’t care about me that I’m an evil and hateful human being, and worse than my physically and mentally abusive dad and I just feel really tired. I’m 19. I wish I could just end it right this time. If you’re reading this, SO, I love you so so much. You’re my world."

DO NOT respond to anyone who takes conversations to PM right away! We've learned that someone is reaching out to ""help"" some of our OPs via PM, tricking them into clicking links that go to IP tracing sites, and passing the information on to police.  **We cannot overstate how much we deplore this reprehensible and frankly stupid behaviour!**

As a suicide intervention strategy, it's beyond misguided, and likely to cause more suffering and death than it prevents (see below).  Further, it's a violation of both our subreddit rules, and reddit's TOS.  We, with the help of the reddit admin team, are doing all we can behind the scenes to put a stop to this, but the anonymous nature of reddit means that people can sometimes find ways around the counter-measures, so please be forewarned.  

If you're here to **get** help, please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules, and please report and then ignore any responses or PMs you get that violate them.  Consider whether you actually want help from someone who either doesn't care enough to learn the rules of the community before participating, or who thinks they are above the rules or know better than we do.  The SW mod team, collectively, has about 40 years' experience in suicide intervention and related mental-health and human services fields.  All of our rules exist for excellent reasons!

If you're here to **give** help, please read and follow the rules.  We know that the points in section 4 of the guidelines may seem counter-intuitive - that's why all of them link to mod posts where we discuss the rationale in detail. All of these rules were arrived at in collaboration with, and with the overwhelming support of, the SW community. The rule about keeping interactions out in public is designed to ensure that bad advice gets debugged, and that our helpers don't get overwhelmed or overcommitted and end up letting people down. ***Most of the problems we end up dealing with in modmail are the result of helpers violating the one or more of rules in section 4, whether deliberately or inadvertently.***

I also want to say a bit about the SW mod team's philosophy regarding confidentiality.  We don't believe in ""outing"" anyone who posts here unless there's a credible threat of harm to *others*.  We know that anonymity makes it possible for people who are having really dark thoughts to open up and talk about things without fear of having it come back to haunt them, or without fear of people making assumptions about them based on their personal history.  Anonymity is in itself a safety measure in suicide intervention, and the rare cases where it leads to a bad outcome are not typical - they're like the freak-accident scenarios where someone is strangled by a safety harness or smothered by an airbag.   

There seems to be a widespread perception that calling police and arranging an involuntary intervention is the only/best thing to do when someone expresses any kind suicidal ideation - that's absolutely not true! Suicide hotlines don't do this very often at all. For example, the hotline I work at breaches confidentiality roughly 0.2  percent of the time - that's **once in 500 calls**, even though almost every call involves some degree of suicidal ideation. An involuntary intervention is regarded as a failure - having your privacy violated is incredibly traumatic and it *always* sets people back, so hotlines do everything they can do avoid it.  

Hotlines welcome calls from concerned third parties. If you encounter someone anywhere who you think may be at risk for suicide, we strongly recommend that, unless you have sound reason to believe that a suicide attempt is already in progress, your first call should be to your local or national suicide hotline. They can do an expert risk assessment in real time, and quickly help you identify the best next steps. If *they* suggest calling the police, then of course you should do so, but most of the time they'll offer you a less drastic and more therapeutic way to help the person you're concerned for.

I know that when my wife was younger she struggled with suicidal thoughts, but she has continued therapy for the last 18 years and largely been successful.  We've been married for nearly 4 years now and it's a particularly stressful time due to finances, my transitioning to a new job, several major problems with our home, and a viscous lawsuit from a neighbor who wanted our dog.  (Was dismissed but took a year to get to court and was very stressful.)

She seemed to be in fairly high spirits the last three days and this morning was in a particularly good mood.  As the morning went on we talked, I told her how happy I was she'd saved my favorite shirt from a stain, and she was laughing and joking with me.  She decided to do some chores and I played Xbox.  About an hour later I got up to get a drink and noticed she wasn't in the main portion of the house so I went upstairs to check on her.  Found her in bed with a bottle of muscle relaxers I got for a bad back and a bottle of her own daily mood stabilizers.  She had taken about 27 muscle relaxers and around 150 of the mood stabilizers in addition to a full bottle of Tylenol, and she had attempted to use razors to slash her wrists and throat.  Thankfully she is very afraid of cutting herself and was not successful.  I carried her downstairs and took her to the ER.  (Didn't know how many pills she had taken or would have called 911, thought it had been much less.). Took the bottles with me and they sedated her and put her on a breather.  It was absolutely terrifying.
She is in ICU but Tennessee has some rule where nobody can see or visit her until the doctor decides they can so I'm sitting at home trying to decide what to do.  I'm not allowed to call or be there so I got a nurse to let me write her a letter telling her I love her and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support her through this rough time.

I've noticed when she drinks she tends to get more depressed, so when I got home I dumped all the alcohol in the house.  I like beer but not as much as I liked her.  Hopefully keeping something that triggers her out of the house will help some.  I kind of feel like I'm taking her choices away though and I want her to feel independent and worthwhile not like a child who is in trouble.  Do you all think this is the right call?

Has anyone had experience with this in Tennessee and if so how long did it take for you to see/be seen by your loved ones?

Since she took my prescription is there any chance of criminal charges?  I don't care about the pills or lawyer bills I just don't think she needs to experience another trial.

Can the state forcibly put her in a treatment facility and if not as her husband can I put her in an outpatient program?  I think she will want to act like this didn't happen but I want her to get help.

If I can put her in an outpatient program do y'all think it would be a positive? Again I want her to feel free and validated.

What things can I do to better prep our home to be a safer environment while she's works through this?

Thanks for reading and for any answers.  It has been a terrible day."

Thank you. Three years ago, I was in the worst place of my life. I had undergone a prolonged and horrific traumatic experience the year before, and then was thrust back into normal life as a ""typical"" high school student. I was surrounded by people who supported my abusers, and felt that what had happened to me was my fault (and people supported this idea). 

And then, I had a glimmer of hope that was so wonderful and unimaginable that not only would all my troubles be subsided, but I felt that it would make all my troubles *worth it*. But alas, I made a very stupid mistake, and I alone sabotaged myself. 

I joined Reddit and found this subreddit, and [cried for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1swjeq/what_do_you_live_for_when_you_dont_have_anything/?). Redditers were patient and understanding. 

Of course, I thought much of what they told me (it got better, other great things would happen to me, I would learn to live with my regrets) was bullshit. It annoyed me at the time, though I was warmed by the fact that people sought to comfort me. My mind was going in circles. It was stagnant. I had never experienced that. It was a very dark time.

I had to push through another year - and it was perhaps the hardest year of my life - but somehow, I made it through. You couldn't pay me anything to relive that time. Through fantastically random events, I got the opportunity to leave home and have a ""fresh start,"" and then went off to college, where I was able to think with a clear mind. It wasn't an easy transition. It was easy in some aspects - I wasn't homesick, like others in my college freshman dorm - but looking back on it, it was an adjustment. 

I am now much further into college. Wonderful things have happened in my life, and I truly do like living. It's not that I get up everyday and short, ""I love life!"" But three years ago, if I had a chance to just disappear and stop living in a small, painless instant, I would take it in a heartbeat. Now, I would not. I have had opportunities that are very different from the one I messed up. I can't compare them to the one I lost - it's not that one is better than others; they are merely different. I have been honored to have wonderful experiences that I couldn't have imagined three years ago. 

Back then, I wracked with guilt and shame, hatred for myself and for many others. I hated when people would say, ""It gets better"" because I felt it applied to everyone, but me. But it did. Things did get better. 

Thank you all for your patience. Thank you all for your compassion. Thank you all for your empathy. 

It has literally meant the world to me."

And how much do you stop yourself from reaching out? I have one person in my life that knows about my suicidal tendencies and depressing thoughts, the first person I talked to after bottling up every negative emotion for 7 years.  And I'm back to holding things back and keeping them inside.  Any time I want to talk to her and just chat about what I'm feeling, I stop myself cause my stupid mind says ""uh uh, why should she have to listen to your BS anymore.  She didn't ask to be your vent, she has her own problems."".  I had like 3 good nights of talking after I first talked to her and then that was it.  Anything else was quick interjections in normal conversations like ""hey btw [insert quick comment/question].  Anyway..."".  I'll type out whole paragraphs to her or sometimes for posts on here, and I'll catch myself in the middle of it and go ""oh shut the hell up, no one wants to listen to your complaining you wuss.  Get over it already."".  Then I delete it all and stay quiet.



I'm a little less ""strict"" with myself on here cause no one knows me and it's easier to just delete the post later or whatever, but y'all get the gist.



I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't want to bother her even though she says it won't, that's just how my mind works.  I don't want to reach out to another friend and risk having another person know about what I'm thinking.  I don't want to go to a professional cause again, don't want people finding out.  I'm stuck."

I have mild untreated depression that tends to come and go in waves. This last wave has been particularly long. I should be happy but I’m often not, and sometimes get into a short funk where I just feel like I can’t do anything - like ill sit for a few minutes and just do nothing because the weight of emotions is too much to bear. Lately I have been thinking about suicide but I know I wouldn’t go through with it - I have a contingency plan sorta like that guy who decided he was going to kill himself and went to Mexico for hookers and blow and realized he wanted to live - but a much less extreme version.

Does having these thoughts count as being suicidal even though even though I know I won’t pull the metaphorical trigger?"
