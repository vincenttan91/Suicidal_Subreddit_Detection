,SuicideWatch,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.

It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I'm Gretel, 18 year old Mexican female. I want to be brief, I tried to kill myself two months ago. My psychologist told me about this social media site so I come to share what I feel.

I jumped off my house rooftop (3 story-house) butI only broke my arm. I feel stupid because I couldn't kill myself. 

All my suicidal thoughts started when at age 5, I accidentally caused an accident which killed my sister. She was my twin, 5 as well. My parents won't stop blaming me for her death.

To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy.

Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, the relationship felt off from right when it happened. I don’t have the heart to tell him because I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed again (shooting heroin and popping benzos). It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. I’ve been wanting to break up with him but now he’s in a bad place and I feel stuck. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 4 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year he has ever not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore.

&lt;p&gt;This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• • • • •&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so, so tired.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up?

,SuicideWatch,"3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.

I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. &lt;/p&gt;

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times.

 It's really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope, dreams and joy in life. How it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty.

This guy was a legend. He tried his best, but still unable to find strenght to carry on. I believe this is the worst way to go. 

I wish I said something more, I wish i knew better.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope, dreams and joy in life. How it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy was a legend. He tried his best, but still unable to find strenght to carry on. I believe this is the worst way to go. &lt;/p&gt;

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster. 
~••••••~
2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm. 
~•••••~
2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend.

I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone.

It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more.

2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster.

2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm.

,SuicideWatch,"Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough.

Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don&amp;#39;t know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn&amp;#39;t easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I&amp;#39;ve now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn&amp;#39;t even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn&amp;#39;t even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I planned my entire life around someone who I&amp;#39;ve never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i&amp;#39;m sure my boss won&amp;#39;t be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won&amp;#39;t affect anyone&amp;#39;s schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn&amp;#39;t make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I&amp;#39;ve never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that&amp;#39;s okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don&amp;#39;t plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can&amp;#39;t thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. I&amp;#39;m going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best I can.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death.

A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.


I've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. 


And now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. 


I have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: ""I made this"" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called ""spam"" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying ""I made this"" to ""I found this."" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)

What else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these ""instapoets""? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.


I lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job. Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me! And people were praising what I was doing in college...I feel like Nick Drake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw


I've never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things. There's a million other things. I have no money. I don't have money for rent next month.

Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me! And people were praising what I was doing in college...I feel like Nick Drake &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things. There&amp;#39;s a million other things. I have no money. I don&amp;#39;t have money for rent next month. I don&amp;#39;t have money for food. Some of you might not understand but I&amp;#39;d rather die than take unemployment benefits. I am more suicidal than you can possibly know. I am trapped. Stuck. I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m 29 and in this position. All those dreams I had as a kid about being the next JK Rowling...I&amp;#39;ve been doing a lot of research. I have a method figured out. It seems almost inevitable that I will end it. I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down.

&lt;p&gt;I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven&amp;#39;t sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn&amp;#39;t leave a suicide note that day. I probably won&amp;#39;t ever leave a note when I go. Ideally, id just fade away.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&amp;#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&amp;#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&lt;p&gt;Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts.",t2_2hc6c9wy,False,,1,False,"I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself..",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_9rq2jd,False,dark,0.98,,public,642,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,642,,False,,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1540628341.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I&amp;#39;m not very good at English, as it&amp;#39;s my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven&amp;#39;t opened up about this incident in my life, until today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to end it all but I&amp;#39;m such a fucking pussy so I think I&amp;#39;d rather destroy my health with more drugs until one day I&amp;#39;ll eventually take a little too much and leave this earth forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for the nice messages :)&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a male and it&amp;#39;s already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure (at least in Germany) but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever encountered shit like that?&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

,SuicideWatch,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&amp;#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&amp;#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&amp;#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&amp;#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&amp;#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&amp;#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&amp;#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&amp;#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&amp;#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&amp;#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...

Then I grew up just a little and that&amp;#39;s when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don&amp;#39;t think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We&amp;#39;ll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn&amp;#39;t know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don&amp;#39;t care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don&amp;#39;t think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn&amp;#39;t want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved *this is just how I felt at the time* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I&amp;#39;m 36.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn&amp;#39;t like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn&amp;#39;t true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I&amp;#39;ve ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I&amp;#39;m a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don&amp;#39;t like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I&amp;#39;m a liar, and hates me to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn&amp;#39;t think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn&amp;#39;t want to use me. She didn&amp;#39;t want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn&amp;#39;t really care. I love her... but I didn&amp;#39;t care. At least she wasn&amp;#39;t in pain....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don&amp;#39;t have to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON&amp;#39;T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might&amp;#39;ve. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to kill myself. Have it planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I&amp;#39;m waiting. I tell myself, &amp;quot;When he dies. I go to.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I&amp;#39;m a &amp;quot;little&amp;quot; closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 36, I&amp;#39;m doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She&amp;#39;s nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn&amp;#39;t answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;complicated&amp;quot;. I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn&amp;#39;t work in the building with us. Hadn&amp;#39;t seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn&amp;#39;t looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn&amp;#39;t misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won&amp;#39;t. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don&amp;#39;t think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it&amp;#39;s just terrible timing. Or this is hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#39;m done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn&amp;#39;t even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can&amp;#39;t be happy I guess. Fuck this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn&amp;#39;t have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn&amp;#39;t have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It&amp;#39;s not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, &amp;quot;how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?&amp;quot;. So I guess my mind wasn&amp;#39;t playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn&amp;#39;t play games. All I know is I can&amp;#39;t choose how I feel and I bet she&amp;#39;s no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don&amp;#39;t think, just do. But fuck, I&amp;#39;m still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. &lt;/p&gt;

I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

,SuicideWatch,"My best friend killed himself at the end of September, and I still can't handle it. I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  If the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and I’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. I wish i never existed. And I’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared and i feel hopeless. I feel like death is my only way out.

UPDATE 9/6/19: So today I found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. And he already has a kid. So he has two kids now. My anxiety is a little calm now because I’m sure if he had HIV they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore. I’m still disgusted by my body now and I feel dirty ashamed.

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions.

The process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through. My co workers finding out, how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you guys go through the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.

I didn&amp;#39;t see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back &amp;amp; took me along with her to this small town that I&amp;#39;m in now. I think I&amp;#39;ve spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I&amp;#39;ve been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can&amp;#39;t drive, I don&amp;#39;t have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I&amp;#39;ve dreamt of practically all my life &amp;amp; they&amp;#39;re so far away. It&amp;#39;s becoming unbearable at this point. My mother &amp;amp; I aren&amp;#39;t on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me &amp;amp; I called the cops on him. I don&amp;#39;t have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends &amp;amp; I live in a small town without any real opportunity&amp;#39;s available. I&amp;#39;m living off my mother &amp;amp; the minute she decides I have to go I&amp;#39;m going to be homeless. Recently I&amp;#39;ve been begging her to take me to just get an id &amp;amp; help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me &amp;amp; I know this is my problem but i don&amp;#39;t have any money &amp;amp; I don&amp;#39;t know what or how I&amp;#39;m supposed to do it. All I&amp;#39;m asking for Is just a job so maybe I can figure things out but I can&amp;#39;t even have that. I fucked up &amp;amp; now it&amp;#39;s too late for me. My only option is suicide which is inevitable but I&amp;#39;m scared &amp;amp; I want to live.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible.

The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.

Force closed the app. I went for a walk with my son who’s under one. I forgot I had even posted this till right now while I’m sitting on the toilet a day later.

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm  24 years old. On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum.

I&amp;#39;ve had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn&amp;#39;t have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I&amp;#39;ve been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It&amp;#39;s all a temporary measure in  the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a &amp;#39;High Performer&amp;#39; in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and &amp;#39;open up&amp;#39; about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I&amp;#39;ve taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it&amp;#39;s  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we&amp;#39;re all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

When I was twelve I took 58 tablets of paracetamol and I was pretty much fine. I told my parents and we went to the ER, but I just vomited a couple times and then I was good

I’ve tried many night to suffocate myself in my sleep with a pillow, and yet I always wake up.

I tried to overdose again when I was 14, I took like 30 of a tablet I don’t remember and I didn’t tell anyone, all that happened was my stomach really hurt and I was super hungry for a week after.

I don’t have the balls to actually cut myself, but if guns were legal in Australia I would have been dead for 4 years. 

Recently I have had no drive to do anything but just lay in my bed and watch videos. I don’t deserve life. Imagine someone who is fighting to survive from Coronavirus or some cancer or whatever, and they have 100s of people who love them, they love their self, but they end up dying. And then theirs me. Who doesn’t want to fight or do anything. Why not give them life and take it from me.

I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled. I have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out I wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. I have to wear a mask everywhere I go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. It doesn’t help either that every adult I know doesn’t take me seriously because I’m not an adult.

,SuicideWatch,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story.

Then why can&amp;#39;t I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways.

,SuicideWatch,"I am a 31 yo gay male who was severely bullied throughout my childhood whilst having to come to terms with my sexuality. Nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when I was growing up it was not. I was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. I was very confused and vulnerable at the time so I felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.

As a result, I developed OCD and body dysmorphia. From that point on I thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if I was perfect. I strived for perfection; i was a straight A student, I ate really healthy, I was physically active and I valued my appearance above all else. I could confidently say that I was an attractive guy and I know now I had a lot going for me. Regardless of how hard I tried to be perfect over the years I developed social anxiety and although I had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and I missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. Slowly but surely I was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. I had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. 

When I turned 29 I fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. I thought I could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. It wasn’t until we moved in together that I realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - Like I was back in high school. He was a sociopath but I didn’t realise until it was too late. He abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til I was nothing. 

After 2 years of torment I finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. My body dysmorphia and OCD came back but with extreme vengeance. I dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. My hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so I went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst I was there I also got Lipo on my stomach even though I know now I didn’t even need it. I came back from Turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. I was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.

It all took a turn for the worst when I started focusing on my skin. My skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. I researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. I bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. After the first few sessions I noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. I brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. Cut to the last session I got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. In the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face I look deformed. My entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. I have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. This disfigurement is permanent and I look like a monster. 

I have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but I just can’t. One told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value I put on myself was in my appearance. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to die. I feel like if I didn’t have body dysmorphia Which is obviously making the situation so much worse I may have stood a chance. 

I have taken a month off work for the Christmas period and have been staying at my parents because I’m too scared to be alone. For the past month  I have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. Every part of my being has given up on life and I havnt left my room. I have been researching ways to end my life and I feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. My worst fears have come true.

My parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. I wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. Everyday for the past month I have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. My brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. He showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. Unbeknown to him this is how I plan to end it.

I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love.

That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms.

I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me.",t2_602mr5em,False,,0,False,I'm this fucking close to ending it.

I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he&amp;#39;s willing to pay the $55000 ~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn&amp;#39;t die and the world doesn&amp;#39;t end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university&amp;#39;s I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I&amp;#39;ll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I&amp;#39;m a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I&amp;#39;m so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I&amp;#39;m equally as close to just ending it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don&amp;#39;t know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I&amp;#39;m feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To those who might be a bit confused, I&amp;#39;ve begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she&amp;#39;s in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn&amp;#39;t go, military and 70&amp;#39;s). The reason why I haven&amp;#39;t gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don&amp;#39;t want to waste my mother&amp;#39;s time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don&amp;#39;t want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven&amp;#39;t gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

I&amp;#39;m so scared I&amp;#39;m gonna hurt a kid and I actively avoid them. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. I feel like tonight is a good night. It&amp;#39;s Sunday and I&amp;#39;m alone.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm posting this here because I just need a place to scream. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.

Anyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the ""old school"" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. 

Anyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.

Anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard.

,SuicideWatch,"I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.

It's telling that it's taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things.

Suddenly, some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home.

Standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended, almost like they've finally realized there are more important things on the line. Not that that matters to me, because I'm a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience.

Carbon emissions have dramatically decreased. Don't know the full facts, but I've heard that air quality in notorious places like China is actually somewhat breathable now.

So I hate when people tell me things like how it gets better, or how I'm going to be successful. Everyone beats around the bush. No one wants to admit that I'm a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything. I wish humanity would burn to ashes.

I dropped out of college 3 years ago and I've been living with my parents since then. I have no job and don't really do much from day to day. About the only passion I have in life is video games, and I've recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of RPGs on a personal blog. Of course, because I don't know shit about promoting it, it's never going to take off in views and I'll never be able to actually TAKE that passion anywhere.

So, as someone who's dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I've wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don't have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.

And yet it hasn't changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I'm still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I'm running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.

The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that's the life I've always WANTED. If I didn't have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I'd read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I'm not attending school and don't have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I'm a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I'm going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?

I was so close to the finish line. One of my current ""obligations"", if you can call it that, is that I've pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn't pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I've gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I'm excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.

But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I'm never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can't just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I'd want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.

The one silver lining is that I'll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I'm not sure that means much when I'm a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I'm trapped in a corner because I'm a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.

I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I've been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?

Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I'm useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I'm a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die.",t2_60q1vrng,False,,0,False,I wish humanity would burn to ashes.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_fure5q,False,dark,0.95,,public,411,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,411,,False,,1585996791.0,,[],{},,True,,1586024738.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, as someone who&amp;#39;s dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I&amp;#39;ve wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don&amp;#39;t have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet it hasn&amp;#39;t changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I&amp;#39;m still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I&amp;#39;m running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that&amp;#39;s the life I&amp;#39;ve always WANTED. If I didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I&amp;#39;d read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I&amp;#39;m not attending school and don&amp;#39;t have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I&amp;#39;m a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I&amp;#39;m going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so close to the finish line. One of my current &amp;quot;obligations&amp;quot;, if you can call it that, is that I&amp;#39;ve pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn&amp;#39;t pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I&amp;#39;ve gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I&amp;#39;m excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I&amp;#39;m never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can&amp;#39;t just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I&amp;#39;d want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one silver lining is that I&amp;#39;ll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I&amp;#39;m not sure that means much when I&amp;#39;m a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I&amp;#39;m trapped in a corner because I&amp;#39;m a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I&amp;#39;ve been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I&amp;#39;m useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I&amp;#39;m a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"If anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, I'd strongly urge them to not read any further because I would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&amp;#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you.

I am sick, if I wasn’t sick I wouldn’t have taken my life. I couldn’t bear this weight anymore. It has destroyed and taken from me everything that I am.

I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family.

I don’t feel as if I need to really explain much; you knew I was suffering. 

Admittedly or not; you knew. 

And you can say I’m selfish.

And you can say that I’m a coward. 

And you can say that I couldn’t have been helped.

And you can say that this mindset was a choice.

And that you don’t understand.

And that you didn’t expect this. 

And that you wish things were different.

And that you’re hurting. 

But you’ll be okay. 

And I’m not selfish. 

And I’m not a coward. 

And you’re right, maybe I could’ve been saved; but I wasn’t. 

Someone once told me that I wasn’t broken, that I just needed someone to choose me. To love me. 

And that’s more than true. 

How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? 

Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. 

That I’m special. 

I am luminous. 

I am warm.

I am beautiful.

I am talented. 

I am smart. 

I am magnetic.

I am powerful. 

But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. 

Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, 

Just so show that you have me. 

But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. 

And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. 

Beautiful they say, precious even. 

Kept safe. Appreciated. 

Used when deemed appropriate. 

Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  

When treated at all. 

Packed away. 

And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.

I tried to give myself meaning. 

To feel loved without touch. 

But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, 

And my voice muted 

My pain overlooked

My cracks sanded over, but never filled

What could really be expected?

My mother HURT ME. 

She hurt some of you. 

She hurt herself. 

And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. 

IM fucked up because of it. 

I remember. 

I remember.

I remember. 

I FUCKING REMEMBER. 

I wish you’d let me talk about it.

I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.

I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. 

I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. 

Because I wasn’t. 

And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. 

WHAT HAPPENED to her was. 

And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. 

But something did. And YOU know. 

So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. 

Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. 

Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. 

Talk about your traumas. 

I made my own decision, I did. 

Talk so each other. 

Please. 

I tried. 

I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. 

I tried to create something with what I had.

To play the cards I was dealt… 

but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). 

Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, 

but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. 

So I folded. 

I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. 

I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. 

God sent me here to teach a lesson. 

About truth. 

About pain. 

About compassion. 

About how time doesn’t stop. 

Or something, I don’t know. 

I don’t have much else to say. 

I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind

That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin 

When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. 

I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. 

Please take care of him. 

He’s an angel. Truly. 

Here’s to best chances 

At peace 

At closure 

At warmth

At forgiveness 

Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see

No lies 

Just love 

Like snow 

Like gold

I will be pure.

&lt;p&gt;How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I’m special. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am luminous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am talented. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am smart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am powerful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so show that you have me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful they say, precious even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kept safe. Appreciated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used when deemed appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When treated at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packed away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to give myself meaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To feel loved without touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And my voice muted &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pain overlooked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cracks sanded over, but never filled&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could really be expected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother HURT ME. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hurt some of you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She hurt herself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IM fucked up because of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I FUCKING REMEMBER. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you’d let me talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I wasn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHAT HAPPENED to her was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But something did. And YOU know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about your traumas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my own decision, I did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk so each other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to create something with what I had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play the cards I was dealt… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I folded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God sent me here to teach a lesson. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About compassion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About how time doesn’t stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or something, I don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much else to say. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please take care of him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s an angel. Truly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s to best chances &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At peace &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At closure &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At warmth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At forgiveness &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No lies &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just love &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like snow &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like gold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be pure. &lt;/p&gt;

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years.

I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.

Every day I wake up to a physical pain in my chest. It's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through Aspirin or ibuprofen or Tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. Every day I wake up and feel it. But I go to class; I do homework; I smile; I laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. I'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. But I can't. I'm tired. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being alone. 

Every day I cry. Most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes I don't have that luxury. I work at my school's library, and the other day I was assigned to sort books. While I was working, I lost it. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. When I finally left, I stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.

I just don't know what to do. I've never had a girlfriend, and I was a virgin up until 21 til I finally had enough and paid a prostitute. It was shit. I couldn't perform because I was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. No passion whatsoever. All through high school I watched my friends get in relationships. I listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. I enjoyed their company, I considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.

Then, finally, at 22 I met a girl through Tinder. I really really REALLY enjoyed talking to her. We talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time I've been happy in years. Every day I was checking my phone multiple times a minute. Some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night I can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. I want someone to want me and enjoy my company. 

When we met up, I thought things went well. We hooked up. The sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. But a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. Now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. This was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.

But *I* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *I* was too much work. 

And that broke me. Whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. For years, I've tried to socialize. I've tried clubs, I've tried jobs, I've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't physically attractive, but then I got in shape and it changed nothing. So I gained a little weight back, and then I met her. I had a chance with a girl. I thought she liked talking to me as I liked talking to her. But I was wrong.

Through her I discovered the truth; I'm fundamentally flawed. I can't socialize. I'm not attractive. There is *nothing* physically impressive about me. I have no hobbies. I'm boring as shit. I'm awkward. I have no redeeming qualities *at all*. I don't know what to do about it either. I tried a number of hobbies. Skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. It all bored the shit out of me. I had *zero* fun. 

I lie to everyone. I tell people I got laid in high school. I tell them I had a good size friend group.

I met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.

Things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.

One day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.

On the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).

When she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.

After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.

She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.

Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.

We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:

* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)
* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?
* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?

Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.

**Edit**

Thank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.

To clarify some things:

Whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.

I’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health.

,SuicideWatch,"TLDR at End

I have been passively suicidal for some time. Lately, it had become more active; I was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress I was under. 

Last Monday night, I took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. I obviously failed, but I felt strange... unfulfilled? I didn’t sleep that night; I just cried. 

Tuesday I went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while I was training new employees. I just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. I also got a snap of lucidity. I blurted out to my office manager “I need to go to the hospital” and left work. 

When I got to the ER, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. I looked at her and just said “I am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. They immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. They had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the ER doc came and interviewed me first. 

The ER doc decided I needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. At some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and I just started laughing. Uncontrollably. The nurse looked troubled by this. She asked if that was normal for me and I said yes, especially when I was really stressed and anxious. 

She started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. It was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment I should receive. She told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. I asked if I had a choice in this matter and she just said “No, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. We are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”

I just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”

The three days went by slowly. No tech, no outside contact. Just treatment groups (I painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. 

At the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if I was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and I said yes. 4 hours later I was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. I was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays I have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. They are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. I have my first full day of PHP on Monday. 

I always avoided seeking help. When I went to the hospital, I had truly given up. They were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. 

If you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. The cost can seem prohibitive. The social stigma can be repulsive. Admitting you need help can seem impossible. 

I’m not paying for my hospitalization or PHP; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. No one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. And if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. 

I have learnt a lot the past several days. I entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. Please, consider going to the hospital.

What I am going to do is inexcusable and I know I'm going to put a lot of people through a lot of pain.

Anybody who knows me well, knows that I've had suicidal tendencies for a long time. I'm sick of making what are basically just thinly veiled threats. It's time for me to take action, and take control.  


I blame myself for everything. Every day I am doing new things that I'm going to feel insecure about later. All of these things mounting on top of each other and fuelling my anxiety to become worse and worse. It never gets better, existing just feels like continuous torment and struggle.

,SuicideWatch,"I only have ever wanted to feel love.  I’ve always wanted to be loved.  But I struggle to feel connected to people, I struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  I’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  

If there’s anything that I’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  And I could never understand why.  But “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  It’s my fault people leave.  I always do something to mess it up.  Because I’ve never understood how to relate to others.  

People have told me I’m too difficult to love.  People have left me after seeing how sad and anxious I really get.  I’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  

I’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  He diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me I’d never have normal relationships ever again.  My life felt like it ended that day.  I was fifteen.  I’ve never been the same since.  Since then, I’ve felt like I was born wrong.  My entire existence was a mistake.  I was inherently beyond repair.  Nobody would ever love me again.  

Rejection.  Over and over again.  

I’m not worth being loved.  I’m not worth anyone’s time.  I don’t deserve safety or comfort.  

I feel empty.  I can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.

I’ve hung on as long as I could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  I’ve bargained with myself, I’ve said well, if no one can love me, I’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.

And now, I’m almost 29, and I am truly alone.  I have no one I can talk to.  No one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  I feel connected to no one.  I don’t feel safe around anyone.  Friendships feel superficial.  Dating and relationships are far too difficult.  Sex doesn’t feel good.  Companionship seems impossible.  

I don’t have anyone.

Maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  Maybe I’m one of those people, even though I’ve tried to make something of myself.

I just wanted to be loved.  That’s all.  I just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.

My therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  That maybe someone liked me.  I haven’t been able to cope without her.  Now that she’s out of my life, I truly am alone.  I don’t have anyone I feel like I can depend on anymore.  No one that supports me.  No one I can talk to.

Honestly, in my wildest fantasies, I just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  Tell me I’m a good kid.  That I’m doing a good job.  That I’m a sweet boy.  That I’m lovable.  That they will stay with me.  That I’m good enough.  That my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  That I don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  I wish someone could just look at me and tell me I’m okay exactly as I am.   

Being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  As long as I can remember, I’ve never been good enough and I always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  But it’s exhausting now.  I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this, but I know I have to.  After my body is found and I’m confirmed dead, I’d like to be cremated.  All of my belongings can be discarded.  My cats can go to loving homes - I’m hoping maybe people I know.  My social media can be taken down.  I imagine work and life will go on as normal.  

If my body is found and I’m not dead - I do not want to be on life support, I do not want to be resuscitated, I don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  I do not want any type of end of life care.  I want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  Under no circumstances do I want to be kept alive.

Usually I have work, friends, boyfriend, places to go, things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time. But all I hear when I wake up and when I go to sleep is his laughter, laughter that should have been mine. He&amp;#39;s disabled, so everyone ignores what he did, as if it somehow means it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt me because &amp;quot;he wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to hurt you.&amp;quot; But he DID. I look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take. What&amp;#39;s the point in continuing on if I&amp;#39;m just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I&amp;#39;ll never marry, because I&amp;#39;ll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I&amp;#39;m already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I&amp;#39;ll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I&amp;#39;ll keep pushing people away because I&amp;#39;m so afraid they&amp;#39;ll hurt me. What&amp;#39;s the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they&amp;#39;ll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice. But all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look. But it&amp;#39;s there, it&amp;#39;s always there and it always will be. People always tell us assault victims that we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;survivors&amp;quot; but I don&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;survive&amp;quot;. I want to live. But I don&amp;#39;t think I ever will.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"In the last 6 years I lost my mother to a sudden illness (amyloidosis) married the love of my life, found a successful career with a sweet company car, bought a house, succumbed to alcoholism, attempted suicide, lost my father to alcoholic dementia, lost my my wife, car, house and my job.  I was sober for about 8 months but have been struggling for the last 4 months, jobless in a town without anyone but my 97 year old grandmother.  

I've been hiding my relapse from everyone.  

I flipped out on a friend on Facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  He spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, ""And what about you?  Are you even recovered?""

But honestly, what does all those things even mean?  Do they matter?  Do I matter?  Does it really matter to anyone if I recover?

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

I fucked up. Not in a huge way. Not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term. I'm a lazy asshole. Am I escaping? Am I hiding? And I distracting myself? Doesn't matter. I was supposed to be working. I wasn't. I got reprimanded. And I'm taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today.

So here I am, in tears because I take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally. I don't want to die. Dieing hurts. Dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason. Dieing is complicated. I want to have never existed. Then no one would hurt.

I want to tell people I'm hurt. But it's not their problem. I want to tell people I'm not okay. But who am I to ruin a perfectly good day? People get so upset when you tell them things that suck. I don't want to make anyone upset. So I go through one day where I'm in pain. Then two days. Then a week, a month, two months... I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee. I'd shoot myself with my husband's gun, but I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm too squeamish to open my veins. I don't know how to end this. If I did, I would have left earth months ago.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel. 

And even if I get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and I enjoy absolutely nothing.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm sorry this is so long.

Nobody knows who I am. I haven't had a friend in years. I don't remember what friendship was like. When I talk to people, something always feels off, as if I'm speaking a different language or something. I just want someone to know me. It's so lonely and cold and empty and I just want to scream so loud that I hurt myself.
I was born in Alabama. I was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. My mom is great and has raised me all these years. She left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. I was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. We moved to a new town, she met a new guy. My step dad. He was good at first. We moved to Texas for his new job, he broke. 
Something in his changed. He became abusive. He didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. She was with him from when I was in first grade to fifth grade. 
He started storing food and water in his room. Note, his room. My mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. He thought we were going to poison him. 
Both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.
Even though I was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. Or maybe I'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. At school I had so many friends and everyone liked me. Everyone though I was funny. 
In fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. I started to realize I was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. They started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras.
 My best friend was a boy named Ben. I loved him and I still do. I think about him a lot. His dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was ""gay"" to be a close friend with a girl. He pushed me away and now he's gone. 
I got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. It was for a pep rally. I was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. They changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. So they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. I froze and everyone laughed at me. Or maybe they didn't, I don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. 
I started lying a lot around this time too. Not to my parents, by to everyone else. I made up elaborate fake lives, I still do. They're nothing special, just, different.
My mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. I had to keep visiting him for a while. He had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. One time I was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because I was scared of him. He caught me and called the police on me. I don't know why. My neighbors were watching and called my mom. They were good people. 
The policeman got there and said I was lying. He told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. Then, he forced me to hug my step dad while I screamed and cried in fear. That memory is one of the worst ones I have. He left, and I had to stay at my dads house still. 
He blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. The money, the car, the house, my dog. Just out of spite. I miss her. Her name was ginger. She'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. I don't know if she is. I miss her even after all this time. We packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to Alabama. I lost everything. 
I started to realize I was different in middle school. I did weird things, I acted weird. I would touch other people's hair becuase I liked the way it looked. I still acted like a very young child even at 11. Don't know why. I didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. 
In 7th grade, I became truly depressed. I did ha e someone though. Her name was Mary. She's gone now too.
In 8th grade, I had a bigger group of friends. Everyone still thought I was weird though. I still did weird things, dressed weird too. I know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. She thinks medicine is bad. Pills specifically. That's why I'm not allowed any anti depressants either. 
When highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that I started homeschooling. The homeschooling laws are so lax in Alabama that I barely did anything except play the sims all day. 
In 10th grade, we became poor. Lost the car, lost everything almost. She got a new job in Ohio, we moved again. I lost all of my friends again.
I homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. I thought everything had changed, that I could be normal. It was hell. Everyone hated me. My favorite memory is when I walked into a room to get something, only to hear ""does she seriously dress like that? Wow."". It hurt. We were still pretty poor and I was doing the best I could. All of my clothes were from goodwill. There was one guy there who was nice to me. His name was evan. I hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people I've ever met.
Luckily I'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what I've been doing. It's so lonely. It's so fucking lonely I just want to scream and scream and scream but I can't. I've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. I've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. I feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me I'm not. I posted on amiugly and everyone said I was pretty, I thought it would help but it didn't. 
I've become very paranoid. I'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that I'm dead. I talk to myself. Either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt I am. I'm scared.
I told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. She doesn't know I'm suicidal. That I've been planning out what best way to end it for months. I can't go to therapy. There's a huge scholarship learning abroad program I'm signing up for and they won't let me go if I'm a fucking loon. 
So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only reason I haven't ended it is because I want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. 
I have a sister. I only found out about her when I was 11ish. She's my half sister in my dads side. I don't know how old she is anymore. I was so happy to meet her. It was so good to have a sibling. I felt like I had a real family. She left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. I haven't heard from her in years. The last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. I miss her. She was good. 
Her and my dad won't even know I'm dead. My last birthday was sad. I had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. I didn't have any birthday parties for years because I wanted to have one big one. When it finally came around, I didn't have anybody to invite. It was just me and my mom. I ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. Not terrible at all, but not what I had been dreaming of since childhood.
I'm supposed to turn 17 next month. March the 20th. Please remember me. Please if you have the time, read my story. You'll be the only people to know it except for me. I hope you remember me. I just want someone to know me again. It's so cold being alone.

Goodbye

&lt;p&gt;Edit: this got a lot of attention wow. Thank you guys so much for the support! Especially right now when I&amp;#39;m gonna start college soon. This has really got me to think about where I&amp;#39;m going with this and I&amp;#39;m gonna try and get it out of my system. Even tho these thoughts might come back, at least I know where to go when they do.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, I know it’s forced because I don’t like physical contact and I’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when I’m blacked out and don’t remember. He found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything I do.. right now I’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but I’m fixing.

My cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. But he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. Finally I asked him if my best friend and I could have some time to talk alone. And he FLIPPED. He began screaming at us that we hate him. Why can’t he hear what I was going to talk about. We’re just conspiring against him.

He ran over to me.

He believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows I’m lying. He’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. I kept telling him to just do it.

,SuicideWatch,"Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

The reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.

It’s mostly of simple reason such as :
When we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. So my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. So i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. Then my parents asked what did i say to them. I answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. Then they told me “why did you say that? You should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” I said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. They asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate
Just because of coffee......

And it’s been like this these past few years

They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

&lt;p&gt;It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this story my question is: &amp;quot;now where do i go to find help?&amp;quot; Everything on the Internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. It was already very hard but now its unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she&amp;#39;s in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s.2. Im sorry if its hard to follow or understand, im french from Québec and there isnt much french forum to get help.&lt;/p&gt;

It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? 

I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that's why I needed to throw them out. 

Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I'm just trying to hold out until then.

&lt;p&gt;And then, to top it all off: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The baby is gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And she won&amp;#39;t talk to me, at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can&amp;#39;t get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn&amp;#39;t, and she doesn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that&amp;#39;s why I needed to throw them out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I&amp;#39;m just trying to hold out until then. &lt;/p&gt;

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do.

No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.

For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.

Now later on, we found out about what happened. I think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life I don’t know. Stuff about that day. But here it is:

The day before, I remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. I think I said bye but I don’t really know. That was the last time I ever saw my dad alive.

The next day, I’m waking up for school and I find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. My dad was missing and there had been a car crash.

At school, I confided in one of my teachers about the situation and I was worried at all times.

I get home and play video games with my brother. My dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. A little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. A cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. We arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and I’m freaking out.

For a bit, I thought I had heard that he was just in really bad shape. About 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” I discover that instead, he is dead. I went blank with crying. I was horrified. I was whispering to myself “no” constantly and I was rocking back and forth.

Rocking back and forth when I’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.

I ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so I was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.

I go home after a while along with my family. My brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. At this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. She was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. She was 4 hours away. That’s a long trip. 

She was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. She was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.

I fell asleep and at 1am when I woke up, I go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.

My sister, who I barely see show emotion or cry. Someone who’s older and I looked up to. And she was destroyed by this. I went up to her and hugged her.

My siblings are never affectionate. We hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. My brother and I’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “You’re a bitch”.

So hugging my sister, something I don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.

This ripped my family apart.

Here’s how that day went for my father:

He was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. He got out and left the scene. He walked through the fields so GODDAMN close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. He checked in and I don’t know how long he was in that room but what I do know, is he wrote out his letters. There were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. The police found out about the crash and where he was by now. They were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.

I have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. But the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. To make it seem like an accident. And he failed. But he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. My dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. He never tried getting help and he left his family.

I hate my dad for what he did. But of course I also miss him. This whole post has already taken so long to write because I had to take breaks so I can have mental breakdowns.

I was originally going to explain why I’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead I’m going to say you know what, I’m not even going to continue. I am suicidal but I won’t do it any time soon so I can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but I’m going to use this post to say that...

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
Please don’t.
Don’t do it.
My dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.

I didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe I’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.

My life sucks because of my dad.
He’s the reason I want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.

I hate him. I love him but god do I hate him.

My mom has her own hand in my depression which if I ever do another post, I’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.

&lt;p&gt;No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33.

Also looked back and see it&amp;#39;s a wall of text, apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being &amp;quot;larger&amp;quot; than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren&amp;#39;t uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative&amp;#39;s place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn&amp;#39;t in the sanest of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don&amp;#39;t want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don&amp;#39;t know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn&amp;#39;t mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for &amp;quot;letting him into the house&amp;quot;. She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn&amp;#39;t know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I&amp;#39;m genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I&amp;#39;m similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it&amp;#39;s not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn&amp;#39;t possible with the course work I&amp;#39;m still missing but with the lies I&amp;#39;ve told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don&amp;#39;t know what to fucking do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it&amp;#39;s my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father&amp;#39;s side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to &amp;quot;get your shit together, grandma just died and you don&amp;#39;t give a shit&amp;quot;. I do, I just can&amp;#39;t express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that&amp;#39;s happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I&amp;#39;m a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don&amp;#39;t blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she&amp;#39;s not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they&amp;#39;re doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I&amp;#39;m happy for them. I just see how I&amp;#39;m stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s more I can write out but it&amp;#39;s already a large wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My university has counselling services I can use but it&amp;#39;s fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there&amp;#39;s a waitlist..........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don&amp;#39;t have co-op. All job listings I&amp;#39;ve seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can&amp;#39;t get a job without experience and I can&amp;#39;t get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn&amp;#39;t help as I can&amp;#39;t even stick my foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I&amp;#39;m not around.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don't know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.

I don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. 

Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don't deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.

Anyways back to earlier this year.  This was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and I had failed again.  I have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this Christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so I spent my very first Christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  Things were going downhill and again I was getting more and more depressed.  I started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure I had food to eat.  At this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because I was too negative.  I felt like I was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  I made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as I had done a few times before and do it right this time.

My package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  I was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  I'm always surprised when I think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  After that I was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  My court date is a month away and I am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.

I have tried everything to get better I have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  I have tried DBT and TMS.  I don't understand why I should keep going.  I have completely fucked my life up.  Even in the best scenario I will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  I'll be barred from a ton of jobs that I was interested in.  I can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  I probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  I can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  I just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  My friends and family have abandoned me.  I was evicted when I was in jail and lost most of my stuff, I'm broke.  It just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  I feel like I have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  I am so fucking lonely but as much as I would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  What is the point?  Even if my life weren't a complete shit show I would still feel this way.  I just feel like I am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  This whole year has been like a nightmare that I can't wake up from.  Sometimes I wonder if I actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.  Losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  Why should I continue to wait around for that to happen?

I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don&amp;#39;t know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don&amp;#39;t deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"For most of my life I've just been blissfully unaware. Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:

1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.
2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.
3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says ""VACANT."" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.
4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.
5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said ""I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love."" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.

These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid.

I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I&amp;#39;m a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I&amp;#39;ve never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I&amp;#39;m too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don&amp;#39;t take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I&amp;#39;d rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I&amp;#39;m so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can&amp;#39;t keep things clear in my head. It&amp;#39;s always a jumbled mess. There&amp;#39;s no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says &amp;quot;VACANT.&amp;quot; Even if I tried to learn something, I&amp;#39;d just forget it anyway. I&amp;#39;m going to lose all my friends because I&amp;#39;m so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;#39;t keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we&amp;#39;re all in the same room together, I&amp;#39;m overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don&amp;#39;t say anything. I have nothing to say. It&amp;#39;s like this with everyone. I can&amp;#39;t keep up. I&amp;#39;m slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I&amp;#39;m stupid and empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack emotional intelligence. I don&amp;#39;t know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don&amp;#39;t know how to tell people what they need to hear when they&amp;#39;re feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I&amp;#39;m an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There&amp;#39;s something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend&amp;#39;s family member died recently, I didn&amp;#39;t know what to say to comfort them. I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so sorry. I&amp;#39;m sending you love.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s not enough. There&amp;#39;s something missing. I&amp;#39;m so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they&amp;#39;re upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I&amp;#39;m going to lose all my friends because I don&amp;#39;t know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn&amp;#39;t informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I&amp;#39;ve diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I&amp;#39;ve finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I&amp;#39;m simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I&amp;#39;ll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I&amp;#39;ll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren&amp;#39;t too many connections being made up there. I don&amp;#39;t know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I&amp;#39;m smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I&amp;#39;ve said is true. I just simply can&amp;#39;t keep up with anything. I can&amp;#39;t keep anything straight. I can&amp;#39;t communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don&amp;#39;t know what the fuck I&amp;#39;m going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I&amp;#39;ve always been. I&amp;#39;m so fucking stupid. I&amp;#39;m so ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Title sounds like a joke. It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them.

.I won't give much context, but I (14M) got into an extremely heated argument with my Dad over my academic future. I remained respectful, **but he started beating me** and he told me how I'm crazy for liking history and video games, and that I'm gonna suffer and die alone and that no one and nothing will ever love me. I started crying, a lot, and was going to kill myself, by jumping of our roof. However, my Dad grabbed me and started beating me, whilst telling me that I wasn't his son anymore. I ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and I used that). **Mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because I ''upsetted her and God by wishing for suicide''

It's been a few hours now, **and I'm extremely suicidal and I will certainly take my life unless I get immediate help from someone. I** have no trusted friends or adults around, and I live in a shitty third world country that doesn't have a good police force (besides they'll sympathise with my parents), and no emergency helplines. My phone has no battery either (im typing om computer), so I have no helpline I can reach out to (I think).

Please anyone, someone, I need some support of any kind. A simple DM, or something else like a helpline. Please, I really don't wanna die, but I feel so useless.

Help me.

,SuicideWatch,"A couple of days ago, I finally decided to end my life. I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Life was going well for me. High school was a breeze. I got into a good university for engineering. I had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. 

I fucked it all up.

It began with me being lazy in university. I procrastinated many assignments to the point where I ended a quarter with 3 F's. I try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. Still have GPA above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. However, my FAFSA application was declined because of the poor performance. That was the only way I could afford classes as I did not want to go in debt.

I decide to do work and earn money. I got a job at McDonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since I'm introverted. I work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. Thought I'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than I imagined. 

That same year, I had relationship issues. Around the end of February of last year, I found out my gf had cheated. Though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. I decided to forgive her and continue. Fast forward to May 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. I'm too in love, so I decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, I catch her sending nudes to the same guy. I forgive her again. 

December 2018. Same time I quit my job. I'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (I had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). I'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. I'm struggling.

January 2019. 20-year-old Honda begins to die. I'm left without a car for a month. Girlfriend decides to leave me (To be clear, she meant the world to me. She was the only one close to me). I'm heartbroken. In a desperate attempt to save our relationship. I walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. I promise everything...that everything would get better, and I would fix myself and our relationship. I'm rejected. I'm starting to lose it. 

I can't live in this world without her. She was the only one, the only reason I kept going. We talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. It was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. February 2019. The last time we talk.

I have no one to talk to. She was the only one I could talk to about my personal problems. I had no other close friends. My relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. I'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. I begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. I tell them about my break up. ""That sucks,"" they say. That's all I get. I expected as much....

March 2019. Me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. Pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. I could do this.

Since the break up, however, I haven't felt happy at all. I struggle sleeping. Any thought of her would just make me depressed. There's no escape from her. So many things remind me of her. I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. I break down one day and decide to message her. I explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. No response.

2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, I get fired. I hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.

I'm a failure.

Same week, I learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. I learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. IRS stated that I owed $4,000 from 2012. I was 11-years-old then. I didn't work. So I have that to deal with now. On top of that, I owe $2,000 for my car.

Recently, I've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. There goes my chances of ever fixing that again. To add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom I loved to hang out with. Since shes no longer with me, I'm no longer friends with them. They were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.

So now, I'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. I have a history of cutting. I cut so deep freshman year that I have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. I almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but I pussied out. After what happened to me and my ex in May 2018, I tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately I lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).

I could have stayed in university if I had just done my homework. I could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. I could be making money if I wasn't a quitter. I'm worthless. 

I've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn&amp;#39;t strong enough for me to stay. If I live, I&amp;#39;m only going to live in regret...wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything. I want to die so bad. I&amp;#39;m only 19, but I dont think I&amp;#39;m going to make it to 20.&lt;/p&gt;

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

&lt;p&gt;I won. I fucking won. I learned to not hate people anymore (Go ahead and read the other posts if you please). I learned to enjoy life again. I&amp;#39;m smiling as I write this post. I&amp;#39;ve started helping people as much as I could, and being my gamer self I&amp;#39;ve sent steam gifts to people who can&amp;#39;t afford their own hobby (better gaming than drugs or something, right?). Hopefully this is the last time I&amp;#39;ll ever post here. It&amp;#39;s kinda funny looking back and seeing myself one month ago. I&amp;#39;m a totally new person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... Goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;

It was 4 AM. 

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

""Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.""

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. ""Just a couple more minutes,"" he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. ""So is it ready yet?""

""Don't worry about it.""

I was shocked. ""Thank you, sir.""

I walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal I've ever had in my entire life.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi there. My name is Anna. I'm 25f. This post is going to be incoherent, because I can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. I don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, I'm sorry. 

 I've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. 

The one person I told everything too is so tired. I love him very much, but I know caring about me is a burden. He needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things I don't think I can offer with my brain.

I think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that I have. It's just the truth of my life, and why I'm ready for it to be over. 

I was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. I've been kidnapped / sold. I've been a victim in a shooting. I've been forced to watch children die (murdered). I found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. I've been severely stalked. I watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. I've had friends murdered in college. I've been severely beaten. Hungry/starved. Homeless. There's been so much. And I'm so, so tired. 

If anything, I just want boring years where nothing happens, but I don't think that's possible. Everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. People tell me I'm so strong but I feel so weak.  I don't want to fight to live. I don't want to survive anymore. I wouldn't even call this a crisis because I'm just so ready, so calm and numb.

If my guy sees this, I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you needed. I'm sorry I couldn't get better.  Take care of the cats for me. I hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love. 💙💛

so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

My daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! We are no longer in ICU. We were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. 
She doesn’t remember anything. She doesn’t even remember school that day. She’s so upset that this happened. She said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. 
She was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. 
She’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  And it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one I thought I would have.

I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.

Enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. Legit, when I was passing out, I have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. The first time I attempted, I was fourteen and I was so happy when I passed out and thought it was over. Every time, even.

Can you imagine how angry and disappointed I was this time when I woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so I ""wasn't a danger to myself?"" For nearly three days I was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because I was ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and all those words to describe someone who just REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to die. Three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because I refused medication. It's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, I suppose. Now I'm back out on suicide watch.

I don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that ""for their own good."" Well, I guess it worked in a fucked up way. Now I want to die more than I've ever wanted to, but I'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and I'll be locked up &amp; left to rot tied to the bed again because I've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. Why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? I have NOT reached out for help, I've only tried to die on my own terms, and I get treated like a violent criminal. Do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a ""hospital"" against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?

Why the fuck do people do this to other people? It's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom I thought I had. I really don't want to live, but I'm too scared to try to die. I can't go through that again. Maybe 99&amp;#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years I've never once regretted it. They don't believe me, though. They just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when I'm ""stable."" I'm not a person to them, I'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if I resist, and thrown back out. Nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if I complain because every record tells how ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and ""suicidal"" I am. No rights, no problems.

It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things.

,SuicideWatch,"It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.

&lt;p&gt;Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that&amp;#39;s not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I&amp;#39;m saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I&amp;#39;d blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can&amp;#39;t help someone who won&amp;#39;t help themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn&amp;#39;t care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend&amp;#39;s cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality &amp;quot;take the wheel&amp;quot; for a few days. It&amp;#39;s all kind of a blur.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I&amp;#39;d still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She left, and the message was clear: *you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you*.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn&amp;#39;t enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll see you in a few months dude.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn&amp;#39;t see these people again. I really did love them all, they&amp;#39;d been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn&amp;#39;t feel at all.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn&amp;#39;t remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It&amp;#39;s got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can&amp;#39;t help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn&amp;#39;t wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I&amp;#39;m great, and the solo stuff I&amp;#39;ve posted to &lt;a href=""/r/makinghiphop""&gt;/r/makinghiphop&lt;/a&gt; has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And none of that matters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never thought to myself &amp;quot;the world would be a better place without me&amp;quot;. No, I&amp;#39;m fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples&amp;#39; lives. I&amp;#39;m funny. I&amp;#39;m talented. I&amp;#39;m smart. I&amp;#39;m not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don&amp;#39;t *care*. I&amp;#39;m so exhausted. I&amp;#39;m so done. It&amp;#39;s going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I&amp;#39;m just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can&amp;#39;t fight anymore. I can&amp;#39;t keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can&amp;#39;t just sit here in my parents&amp;#39; house with no job and no purpose. I&amp;#39;m exhausted. I&amp;#39;m all out of fight.  &lt;/p&gt;

##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.

I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m just putting this out there because Reddit seems to be the only place I can talk freely.    
    
I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here. I found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any I have felt in years. There are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief I feel. It's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.

I've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. Tried dressing a lot nicer at work. Figured fake it until I make it. It's worked in the past. But last night I found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. I used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. Then over time I would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. I don't have any more. I bought a Kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. Just ending up cutting a little. However, last night I found myself wanting to buy a gun. However, with me as someone who likes guns I want the gun to have meaning. Isn't that fucked up?

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

&amp;#x200B;

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

&amp;#x200B;

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

,SuicideWatch,"I am 26 years old right now, and not a day goes by where I don't think about my older brother. People used to ask me when I was a kid if I had any siblings and I would always point to my older brother and say ""He's my brother"". 

Now I just say I'm an only child and leave it at that. Half of my friends don't know I had a brother, because I don't want to mention it. 

Well, here goes the story that I never told anyone before. Me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. We used to do everything together. Play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. But with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. 

I used to say rude things to him, I used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but I never really meant it. 
So my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. I remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that I never really know what until I later realized it was about anxiety. 

He taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. It was fun, I used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far It would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. 

Every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when I was just waking up. Sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.

So one day, I woke up. I looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. I guess I slept longer than him, but I never do. He usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. I checked the time and it was 11 am. 
I made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. 
He would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when I did but no one came out the room. I opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. 

That's when I looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. 

I saw the closet was mildly open and that's when I saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. I saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. I remember his skin color looked odd. I thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. I saw something was holding him up and then I saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. I didn't know what he was doing, I thought it was a prank he made to scare me. I touched his chest and then pushed him. I then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. By then tears were on my eyes.

But I can tell you right now, if I had to choose something that tore me apart more... My brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, I would have chose parents reaction. 

My dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason I just didn't want to be in that room anymore and I let myself out to the hallway. Then I heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. I think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. They started sobbing. I went to peek back in the room and then I saw my dad shaking and whimpering. He was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. My mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. I didn't notice it but I was crying too. My whole body was shaking. 

I ripped up all my paper in my room and I felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, I then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. I never wanted to leave the room, and all I could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that I was in. I tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, I used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, I scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but I never woke up. I never woke up.

Every night now, I always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now. 

Every year on the day of my brother's death, I throw a paper airplane to a river, and every day I would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed, from my older brother.

,SuicideWatch,"My sister and I used to be best friends. But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a ""grudge"" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, ""I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself.""

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, ""What? What did you just say?""

""I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already.""

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was ""nice"", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.

,SuicideWatch,"I just need to vent.

I'm a single gay man in my late 30's. Seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. Been there, done that. Have a couple of college degrees. I don't drink or do drugs.

I always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. I found myself working with autistic children and public service which I liked, but it's not a stable job. I had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). Realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, I quickly landed a job in corporate America.

Then I was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the DA, I got five years probation and two suspended sentence. I was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. A year into probation, I got violated for having a bullet. Ironically, I had purchased a gun in case I was facing serious time. So I went to prison for two years. It was awful. There was nothing rehabilitative about it. While everyone talked about getting high once they got out, I talked about getting a job.

I was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. I found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. A year later, it went out of business. I said ""fuck it"" and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. It worked. I landed the highest-paying job I ever got. With health insurance too. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

Lately I had been feeling suicidal. Burned out. Anxious. Overwhelmed. The one thing that kept me going was my job. It took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).

Then I got fired today.

Not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. It's beyond me how they found out. I think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. I was a good worker. I left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. I can't do this again. It's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. That's a lie. Been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. It had to be up to me.

To keep on trying to make it is senseless. It's insanity.

I called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. He was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. I wasn't expecting anything.

I think he understood. Killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.

I've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. I thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told I have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. I'd rather die and leave my savings to her. I feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).

There is this part of me that fears death less. What I fear is my future. At least death is inevitable.

Again, not expecting anything life changing on here. The next few days will be brutal. I have crossed a point of no return today.

EDIT: I spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass, binge eating and sleeping. I looked in the mirror and look like shit. My apartment is a wreck.

,SuicideWatch,"I know this is a bit different from what people typically post on this thread but I don’t know who to tell. I don’t want to tell anyone that I was minutes away from killing myself. But that’s exactly what just happened. 

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. 

When I go home I’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help I’ve been procrastinating on getting. I’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was.

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying. Anyways, I feel like on Reddit it's hard to picture users as actual people so I'll set the scene slightly. Hey, I'm Scarlett and I'm a student currently living in the UK. I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it.

Is it selfish because of the people who care about you? Well, how is me living a life I don't want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them? Moreover, what about the people who have no one to care for them?(Not my case, but still, it's quite a common cause of suicide)

Is it cowardly? I really don't think so. Every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it, so coming to the decision, and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination.

Like when thinking about killing myself I try to remember to before I was born and what it was like and I realize I can&amp;#39;t remember anything because I didn&amp;#39;t exist. It was like a void. The same will happen when I kill myself. no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans can&amp;#39;t even comphrend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me, they have goals and are doing stuff. I have no goals. I have no ambitions and don&amp;#39;t care what anyone else thinks. One day I will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy. fml. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also sorry about the grammar im not gonna edit it cause im a lazy shit.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it. 

Please help me

Edit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. I put the knife away and I will try to sleep for a bit.

Thanks to each and every single one of you

,SuicideWatch,"⚠️ Trigger Warning ⚠️ 
Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.

I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.

Now comes the awfulness.

Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

- - - - - 

“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.

And then this.

Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.

That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.

That’s when things got worse. 

Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.

Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. 

The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.

Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. 

Just 5 minutes.

The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. 

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

My little brother is an absolute mess. The news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened, swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment. Horrible sick people. Someone said something about publishing this in the paper, and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy. Everyone is hysterical. 

The police have already ruled it a Murder/Suicide. 

My little brother Mike is a mess, my mom is a mess, and I’m trying so hard to be strong. Mike can’t understand why his father would do that. Why he’d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself....taking the cowards way out. The suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body. 

Luckily, Mike’s older brother Bill, the girlfriend Megan, and little Eli is okay. But we are all damaged. How will anything ever be okay again? 

This is SENSELESS.

I’ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family. Now I’m collapsed at my fiancé’s, just taking it all in while he holds me tight. I’ve already put an email in to my therapist. Sorry about the crappy writing, and if this is difficult to understand; it’s a complicated situation and I’m barely functioning.

Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the awfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when things got worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together.

My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends.

My mental and physical illness might actually be curable but I don't want to get better. I never enjoyed life and the only reason I am alive is simply due to my parents' selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me. I never asked to be born and no, life isn't a 'gift'. Life is pain, misery and dread.

I am too much of a coward man. I tried to take my life once but didn't do any research on my method so obviously, as you can see, I failed tremendously. I took a bunch of Xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping they'll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing...a simple google search would've saved me some time, because you need HUGE amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die...yet I went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it.

I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit. I wish I had the courage to attempt it again, in a different way, but I'm too much of a pussy. That failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that I'm such a failure that I can't even kill myself. I've been researching suicide methods ever since, but I just can't bring myself to do it, yet I somehow will. I need to.

&amp;nbsp;

Looked up every single suicide method. Most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable. Others, will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and I just don't have the guts to go for it. I am a huge coward. Who knows, maybe I'm just not ready to kill myself yet, as much as I want it??? Possibly.

Jumping in front of a train? Nope, there's a chance of living through it and suffering 100 times more. Jumping off a building? Literally same. If you're unlucky, you can jump off a skyscraper and survive (there's an actual story of some dude who fell off a 47-floor building and survived). Shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since I live in a shithole of a country in Eastern Europe, it's nearly impossible for me to get a gun. I'm currently doing some research on hanging since it's the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and I've read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly. But if you miscalculate, you will either end up decapitated or you'll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you 15 minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging. Overdosing on pills? I can't think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you.

So what am I left with? Oh yes, opiates. Good old heroin. There's stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ODs and said that it was absolute bliss. You just go in a deep sleep and (hopefully) don't wake up. No hallucinations or paranoia or shit that you'd experience with other types of drugs. Just peace. 


&amp;nbsp;

So I started to look for a heroin plug in my area. It's not easy living in a small city because you're out of luck. At some point, I was so desperate that I stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and I just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area. I was met with surprised reactions, some were weirded out, some were concerned. Luckily, I'm not in prison so lucky me I guess, would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something. Long story short, I couldn't find a dealer for the love of me. So here I am, browsing the darknet.

It took me a few weeks to learn the ropes. There's special software like Tails, Tor, PGP/Kleopatra, and the bitcoin wallet of choice. Still, no one will actually guarantee that you don't get scammed. I'm still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that I won't get in trouble. It fucking sucks. I just want to die and I can't understand all the unnecessary struggle I need to undergo. I wish it were as simple as going to the hospital, signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot. Yet, only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows. I didn't choose to come into this life so why am I forced to stay?

I can't find anyone who is willing to fucking help. I have tried reaching out online, both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback I've received was from people who ""want me to get better"". Why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life? Why does everyone care about a random stranger's death so much? I don't want to live, is it a crime to hate life? It certainly seems so.

&amp;nbsp;

There's so much stuff I'm going to risk. I thing I have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback. I'm going to order from him as soon as I figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency. I might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door, who knows? Maybe my pack will get seized. I might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws. Even if I DO get my hands on heroin, I know nothing about it. I don't know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation. Can you freaking believe it? You're trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm. Amazing. I know nothing about how to cook the heroin, how to shoot it up and how much to take. I know nothing about the purity of heroin and I might end up with some shit grade heroin that isn't going to kill me anyway. There's no fucking way to die peacefully. But anyway, I'll go through this. Not sure why I even wrote this, just needed to vent I guess.

,SuicideWatch,"**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had.

,SuicideWatch,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time.",t2_4i9i0,False,,0,False,Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,False,t3_e3nth,False,dark,0.99,,public,180,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,180,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1289364792.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to &amp;quot;Why bother&amp;quot; and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:  &amp;quot;I would be happier if only...&amp;quot; If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn&amp;#39;t work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  &amp;quot;Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.&amp;quot;  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the &amp;quot;Only if...&amp;quot; thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: &amp;quot;I need to be happy.&amp;quot;  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: &amp;quot;The future is hopeless... &amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Look at all the mistakes from the past...&amp;quot;  Never play time traveler.  It&amp;#39;s another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What&amp;#39;s happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can&amp;#39;t reach before you open the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:  &amp;quot;You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!&amp;quot;  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:  &amp;quot;You need to get over it.&amp;quot;  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not &amp;quot;get over&amp;quot; chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m trying, baby, I&amp;#39;m trying.&amp;quot;  Then I let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been traveling in San Francisco for the last week. Since I started planning this trip, my intent had been to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at some point during my stay. I was not planning on returning to my home country. 

I went to the bridge on the second day to scout it out. High barriers and nets prevent jumping off the ends of the bridge with land underneath, but a 4-foot guardrail is the only thing that prevents jumping off the middle of the bridge. I could have done it right then but it was the middle of the day and I was with a friend; really didn’t want to scar anybody. 

So instead, I went back last night around 8pm. I hung around near the welcome center preparing myself for a few minutes, then approached the pedestrian walkway. What I hadn’t predicted was the walkway being closed to pedestrian access at 6:30pm! I was way too afraid of getting caught by the cameras or patrol guards while sneaking over the barrier, so I headed back home and make a plan to return. 

My flight back home was at 6:30am, so I planned to leave my host’s house around 4:30am pretending to go to the airport, but actually going back to the bridge which opened at 5am for pedestrians. I set my alarm-clock for 4am and went to sleep. 

I woke up needing to pee around 2am, and the
full weight of what I was planning to do suddenly hit me. I started having major doubts about the plan working, worried about somehow surviving, chickening out while on the bridge but then missing my flight and getting stuck here, or the patrol people catching me and certifying me under a 5150. That would mean missing my flight, a huuuge medical bill since I don’t have US insurance, and a massive freak out from my family. 

So, after considering all of those factors, I cancelled the taxi I had booked for the GGB and rebooked a new one for the airport. I’m here now waiting to get on the plane. 

Moral of the story: I never thought things like barriers or nets or patrols would deter people, but I guess it worked on me. This would have been my seventh and probably final attempt, the other 6 including overdoses that ended in multi-day comas, slashing my wrists, and starving myself.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello all!

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them.

,SuicideWatch,"I just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before I die tonight. Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. I just couldn't get her out of my mind. That Christmas she introduced me to her family and I saw what a real family is for the first time. Loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. The next year was like a dream. She took me to Europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. The second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. I was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. I trusted only her. By the time exams came around I was in such a terrible state I turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. I did that and tried to get better. I tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. I was in my twenties and had never had a job, I felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

I returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. The only reason I graduated was that I chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as I knew one exam would be too much pressure. Instead I had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

I was so lost and embarrassed in life, I had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. I deleted almost everyone from social media because I couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. Once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the US. Again, it was incredible. I asked her why the hell she was with me. She told me I was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together I would finally be able to build the confidence I needed to succeed. She truly believed in me after all that time. I asked her to marry me. She said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as I had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. She graduated in August and we moved in together in September. She started working at a nearby hospital and I went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. I planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. From September 1st to November 1st this year I no longer had depression. I was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. I was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. Then she left me. She knew everything I'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. I travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

She has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. These last two months have been insufferable. We still sleep in the same bed. All I wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that I'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights I can't help but beg. She has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. She says I'm not a real man, I'm not funny, I'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. I guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and I made her laugh all the time. She doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and I have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but I can't afford to live anywhere else and I can't go back to my mum's house. It's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. She says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. They are *my* family too at this point but I'm not allowed near the house. Her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. I haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. Now I have to go and spend Christmas with a family I thought I'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years. Fuck that. I simply will not do this anymore. I cannot spend another day in this horrible fucking world.",t2_pe9xgxx,False,,0,False,"My last act will be giving my abusive family and ex-fiancee a body to wake up to on Christmas day.

Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can&amp;#39;t cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to &amp;#39;run away&amp;#39; and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (&amp;quot;my life would be so much better if you were never born&amp;quot;). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn&amp;#39;t like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was &amp;#39;permitted&amp;#39; to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn&amp;#39;t kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn&amp;#39;t have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other&amp;#39;s colleges on alternating weekends.

hello reddit.
I would really like to die, because it seems like the optimist in me is completely dead. And that's a good thing, because I can't count the number of times I've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go ""Just wait a little bit longer. You'll be happy someday"". I would like to kill myself, because yes, I'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. I try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. Let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. Before I ask you guys what I want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. There's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.

I've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. It's been rough, and what sucks is just the country I live in, which I'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. It's India. Everyone here is a giant piece of shit. Everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. Doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. What makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation I get from coworkers from my full time job (I don't have friends to depend on). It's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. I don't think I can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimes

The worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time I'm suicidal). When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.

So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.

,SuicideWatch,"This is going to be an extremely long post,and some of this information may seem irrelevant but it all ties together why I just don't want to carry on in this world anymore, so if you make it to the end I'm grateful you read my story. I grew up in a very emotionally abusive household with a schizophrenic mother and a narcissistic father, but I overcame the years of abusive relationships with abusive men and finally found true love in 2007 

  As the title states my husband of ten years passed away from cancer in August, just 3 days after our ten year Anniversary. He fought cancer for a good 2 years but everything happened so quickly. I was his caregiver up until hospice got involved the last 3 weeks of his life. Even at that point I did 90 percent of the work. I'm absolutely traumatized by seeing him waste away, I won't go into too many details because it makes me physically ill to remember him that way, but his tumors were wrapped around his corroded artery and he had a trach tube and a feeding tube. He couldn't speak because the tumors were everywhere in his mouth, so he had to use that stupid text to speech. 

 At this point we had our 3 children ages 2, 9, and 7.
We also had custody of a neice aged 13 and a nephew aged 15. We had them for about 7 years, due to my neice telling me during a visit that her babysitters were sexually assaulting her. I did contact social services in the county they were living in and the 3 other children were interviewed but lied and said there was no abuse. They had already been removed from the home and in foster  care for two years, but my brother and his wife were given back custody. They were scared and threatened every day, and their mother was also physically abusing them and their father too.  In hindsight I should've done more to pursue this family of molesters. When I told social services they said now that my neice was in another county it wasn't worth reporting it and because it would be traumatic to my neice to be interviewed. I have a tremendous amount of guilt for not telling them to fuck off and calling the cops. As the saying goes; hindsight is 20/20. Several months later my brother left his emotionally and physically abusive wife (mind you I was still unaware and very much in denial about his part in this). They all came and stayed with us, my brother and his 3 other children. I found out months later after giving my brother a free place to live he was speaking and visiting his abusive wife the entire time. Once asked to leave he ended up taking his younger two boys and leaving his oldest son with us. I'm kind of unsure why that was the case, but that's what happened. 

My neice went through rough times, lots of bed wetting and attention seeking behavior. She was also extremely mean to my daughter who would've been 3 at the time. I feel like she learned to start problems with people and play victim because that's what her mom did. So many unhealthy behaviors that rubbed off on my daughter. I should have gotten her into therapy right away, but I guess I kind of thought she had talked to me about it and kind of moved on. 

My nephew has always been pretty well behaved, and had some anger twords me for not swooping in earlier to save him. He has always completely shut down when it comes to any sort of emotions. He's a very good kid in general but definitely angry.  Again we had to try and help them unlearn this learned behavior. The swearing and the threats of killing people. 

Fast forward to 2017 when my husband was diagnosed with his cancer. Again, I just can't go into too many details because it's still too painful. It was a solid two years without any intimacy and again me being his caregiver not his wife. It was okay though, all of it because I had something people only dream about. True, unconditional fucking love. I would do it a million times over if I had too. Again though, I have so much guilt for not spending more time with him, but there were 5 kids that needed to be cared for. Slowly all the kids drifted farther and farther away from dad, because I think it was too scary for them to see. The only one who didn't was the youngest, she didn't see cancer guy, she just saw dad. I think she kind of got him through the really, really tough times.  

After my husband passed away, I was not invited to partake in the writing of his eulogy by his family, because according to his mother, I was in no state to contribute, was I? I was really shoved aside by his parents and aunts, but more specifically his mother. To this day she doesn't call or try to see her grandkids, the only remnants of her son. It breaks my fucking heart to see this, I'd be fine never seeing her again, but wtf why don't you see the kids? My husband was a man of very strong faith, and very selfless so he knew he was going to a better place and he felt terrible that he was going to have to leave us. All the children also go to a private school, which now I'm very grateful for. At the visitation and the funeral the kids went right up to him and touched him and said ""daddy's not even in there anymore, he's in heaven."" As someone who struggles with faith, I'm okay with this. The little kids need that faith right now. 

Fast forward about 5 months and my nephew Sean comes for a sleepover, it's Christmas break, so he keeps asking every night if he can sleep over. Alright dude, that's cool, but what's up? Why don't you want to go home? Turns out both parents are physically abusing him, and the emotional abuse every day all day is enough to break the strongest of people. Alright, I'm calling your dad, I will do whatever it takes to keep this kid safe. Throughout all this my brother who's been tn the methadone program for several years finds his wife has been shooting meth for 6 months but hadn't noticed? Things were okay, Sean is openly gay which is fine with me but he also has an extremely foul mouth which I've had to reign in constantly.  Now there's this strange shift in my nieces behavior, and by now she's been in therapy for several months because she said she was suicidal. But it's a really bad shift in her. She's even more spiteful and bitchy and mean to the little kids. And her and Sean are trying to share a room, and I say absolutely not. I sense a very unhealthy connection between those two. A strange co dependency I've never before seen. 

Over this time my neice Kailey decides to come out to me as gay. Okay, that's fine. But are you gay or are you wanting to fit in or get attention. I apologize if that statement offends anyone but I know her and this is the polar opposite of her normal boy crazy behavior. My oldest nephew has been lost in all of this drama between Kailey and Sean. They fight eachother, Kailey beats up all the little kids and is frankly out of control with her behavior. I think Sean coming here has triggered something in her. Something very unhealthy. I believe that not only were her and Sean made to perform sexual acts on these male and female babysitters but also on eachother. I don't know what to do. They must be carrying around a huge weight of shame even though it isn't their fault. My goal is to get Sean into therapy so we can figure some of this out. 

I feel like I've failed my children. Everyone says they need structure, but wtf does that look like when there's six of them and one of me. I have realized every single one of them take advantage of and are very rude to me. I'm tired, tired of missing my husband, tired of going through the motions but just wanting to not be here anymore. I resent mostly my neice for coming here and really affecting my children's behavior in a negative way. I resent my husband for leaving me all alone. I resent my own children because I have to stay on this fucking earth because they need me. I often fantasize how I would die. I wouldn't want them to find me because it would be awful for them. I think about hanging and the second before I kick that stool out I text my friend telling her to get the kids from school and that I'm ending it all. My oldest nephew completely shuts down and won't say a word. His anger is real, one day he pushed me so hard I fell and hit my head very hard. His guilt and shame was immediately apparent. But the realization was holy shit, this kid could beat the shit out of me. I'm working on getting everyone else in therapy (my two nephews and my daughter). My son has been going since before his dad died because he has childhood anxiety and depression and hdhd. 

I'm not a nice mother, I yell and I swear and I ask them wtf is wrong with them for them to act this way. I do feel like as much as they love me, they would be better off without me. They always worry about me, and I would like them to not bear that burden. Every morning I wake up with more and more anxiety, I take .5 mg kolonopin to help  slow down my mind. Sometimes I think I'm just not meant for this world, there's just too much pain and the monotony of every day doesn't help. I'm absolutely lost. Every day the urge to die is stronger. I'm not even afraid anymore. The last few weeks I have truly realized how terrible things are. How awful the kids treat eachother and treat me, how they don't even hear my yelling anymore. How I'm cleaning up after everyone, everyday because nobody helps me. It's like, at first the kids were what got me through and kept me going, but now I feel like anger and sadness is just hurting them. I feel ready to die, but for now I'm going to leave it  in the cruel hands of fate. I'm aware I need help, but there's no time for it. I'm too busy trying to keep these kids from killing eachother and trying to not kill myself. Idk if this was the right place to share my story, but I figured because my want to die is so strong maybe this would be the place.

&lt;p&gt;As the title states my husband of ten years passed away from cancer in August, just 3 days after our ten year Anniversary. He fought cancer for a good 2 years but everything happened so quickly. I was his caregiver up until hospice got involved the last 3 weeks of his life. Even at that point I did 90 percent of the work. I&amp;#39;m absolutely traumatized by seeing him waste away, I won&amp;#39;t go into too many details because it makes me physically ill to remember him that way, but his tumors were wrapped around his corroded artery and he had a trach tube and a feeding tube. He couldn&amp;#39;t speak because the tumors were everywhere in his mouth, so he had to use that stupid text to speech. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we had our 3 children ages 2, 9, and 7.
We also had custody of a neice aged 13 and a nephew aged 15. We had them for about 7 years, due to my neice telling me during a visit that her babysitters were sexually assaulting her. I did contact social services in the county they were living in and the 3 other children were interviewed but lied and said there was no abuse. They had already been removed from the home and in foster  care for two years, but my brother and his wife were given back custody. They were scared and threatened every day, and their mother was also physically abusing them and their father too.  In hindsight I should&amp;#39;ve done more to pursue this family of molesters. When I told social services they said now that my neice was in another county it wasn&amp;#39;t worth reporting it and because it would be traumatic to my neice to be interviewed. I have a tremendous amount of guilt for not telling them to fuck off and calling the cops. As the saying goes; hindsight is 20/20. Several months later my brother left his emotionally and physically abusive wife (mind you I was still unaware and very much in denial about his part in this). They all came and stayed with us, my brother and his 3 other children. I found out months later after giving my brother a free place to live he was speaking and visiting his abusive wife the entire time. Once asked to leave he ended up taking his younger two boys and leaving his oldest son with us. I&amp;#39;m kind of unsure why that was the case, but that&amp;#39;s what happened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My neice went through rough times, lots of bed wetting and attention seeking behavior. She was also extremely mean to my daughter who would&amp;#39;ve been 3 at the time. I feel like she learned to start problems with people and play victim because that&amp;#39;s what her mom did. So many unhealthy behaviors that rubbed off on my daughter. I should have gotten her into therapy right away, but I guess I kind of thought she had talked to me about it and kind of moved on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My nephew has always been pretty well behaved, and had some anger twords me for not swooping in earlier to save him. He has always completely shut down when it comes to any sort of emotions. He&amp;#39;s a very good kid in general but definitely angry.  Again we had to try and help them unlearn this learned behavior. The swearing and the threats of killing people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2017 when my husband was diagnosed with his cancer. Again, I just can&amp;#39;t go into too many details because it&amp;#39;s still too painful. It was a solid two years without any intimacy and again me being his caregiver not his wife. It was okay though, all of it because I had something people only dream about. True, unconditional fucking love. I would do it a million times over if I had too. Again though, I have so much guilt for not spending more time with him, but there were 5 kids that needed to be cared for. Slowly all the kids drifted farther and farther away from dad, because I think it was too scary for them to see. The only one who didn&amp;#39;t was the youngest, she didn&amp;#39;t see cancer guy, she just saw dad. I think she kind of got him through the really, really tough times.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my husband passed away, I was not invited to partake in the writing of his eulogy by his family, because according to his mother, I was in no state to contribute, was I? I was really shoved aside by his parents and aunts, but more specifically his mother. To this day she doesn&amp;#39;t call or try to see her grandkids, the only remnants of her son. It breaks my fucking heart to see this, I&amp;#39;d be fine never seeing her again, but wtf why don&amp;#39;t you see the kids? My husband was a man of very strong faith, and very selfless so he knew he was going to a better place and he felt terrible that he was going to have to leave us. All the children also go to a private school, which now I&amp;#39;m very grateful for. At the visitation and the funeral the kids went right up to him and touched him and said &amp;quot;daddy&amp;#39;s not even in there anymore, he&amp;#39;s in heaven.&amp;quot; As someone who struggles with faith, I&amp;#39;m okay with this. The little kids need that faith right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward about 5 months and my nephew Sean comes for a sleepover, it&amp;#39;s Christmas break, so he keeps asking every night if he can sleep over. Alright dude, that&amp;#39;s cool, but what&amp;#39;s up? Why don&amp;#39;t you want to go home? Turns out both parents are physically abusing him, and the emotional abuse every day all day is enough to break the strongest of people. Alright, I&amp;#39;m calling your dad, I will do whatever it takes to keep this kid safe. Throughout all this my brother who&amp;#39;s been tn the methadone program for several years finds his wife has been shooting meth for 6 months but hadn&amp;#39;t noticed? Things were okay, Sean is openly gay which is fine with me but he also has an extremely foul mouth which I&amp;#39;ve had to reign in constantly.  Now there&amp;#39;s this strange shift in my nieces behavior, and by now she&amp;#39;s been in therapy for several months because she said she was suicidal. But it&amp;#39;s a really bad shift in her. She&amp;#39;s even more spiteful and bitchy and mean to the little kids. And her and Sean are trying to share a room, and I say absolutely not. I sense a very unhealthy connection between those two. A strange co dependency I&amp;#39;ve never before seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over this time my neice Kailey decides to come out to me as gay. Okay, that&amp;#39;s fine. But are you gay or are you wanting to fit in or get attention. I apologize if that statement offends anyone but I know her and this is the polar opposite of her normal boy crazy behavior. My oldest nephew has been lost in all of this drama between Kailey and Sean. They fight eachother, Kailey beats up all the little kids and is frankly out of control with her behavior. I think Sean coming here has triggered something in her. Something very unhealthy. I believe that not only were her and Sean made to perform sexual acts on these male and female babysitters but also on eachother. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. They must be carrying around a huge weight of shame even though it isn&amp;#39;t their fault. My goal is to get Sean into therapy so we can figure some of this out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;ve failed my children. Everyone says they need structure, but wtf does that look like when there&amp;#39;s six of them and one of me. I have realized every single one of them take advantage of and are very rude to me. I&amp;#39;m tired, tired of missing my husband, tired of going through the motions but just wanting to not be here anymore. I resent mostly my neice for coming here and really affecting my children&amp;#39;s behavior in a negative way. I resent my husband for leaving me all alone. I resent my own children because I have to stay on this fucking earth because they need me. I often fantasize how I would die. I wouldn&amp;#39;t want them to find me because it would be awful for them. I think about hanging and the second before I kick that stool out I text my friend telling her to get the kids from school and that I&amp;#39;m ending it all. My oldest nephew completely shuts down and won&amp;#39;t say a word. His anger is real, one day he pushed me so hard I fell and hit my head very hard. His guilt and shame was immediately apparent. But the realization was holy shit, this kid could beat the shit out of me. I&amp;#39;m working on getting everyone else in therapy (my two nephews and my daughter). My son has been going since before his dad died because he has childhood anxiety and depression and hdhd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a nice mother, I yell and I swear and I ask them wtf is wrong with them for them to act this way. I do feel like as much as they love me, they would be better off without me. They always worry about me, and I would like them to not bear that burden. Every morning I wake up with more and more anxiety, I take .5 mg kolonopin to help  slow down my mind. Sometimes I think I&amp;#39;m just not meant for this world, there&amp;#39;s just too much pain and the monotony of every day doesn&amp;#39;t help. I&amp;#39;m absolutely lost. Every day the urge to die is stronger. I&amp;#39;m not even afraid anymore. The last few weeks I have truly realized how terrible things are. How awful the kids treat eachother and treat me, how they don&amp;#39;t even hear my yelling anymore. How I&amp;#39;m cleaning up after everyone, everyday because nobody helps me. It&amp;#39;s like, at first the kids were what got me through and kept me going, but now I feel like anger and sadness is just hurting them. I feel ready to die, but for now I&amp;#39;m going to leave it  in the cruel hands of fate. I&amp;#39;m aware I need help, but there&amp;#39;s no time for it. I&amp;#39;m too busy trying to keep these kids from killing eachother and trying to not kill myself. Idk if this was the right place to share my story, but I figured because my want to die is so strong maybe this would be the place. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, Reddit

My name is Rob, and I have a life changing favor to ask. 

I have debated on making this post numerous times. However I always made an excuse to back out. I’m not sure if this is allowed here, and if it isn’t, I’m truly sorry, but this seems to be the place where I can speak directly with the kinds of people that this message is aimed at. 

This will be an extremely personal look into mental health, and the side effects of said illnesses, but this is the last shot I could come up with. Ok... with all that being said.... 

I have been medically diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Ranging from multiple personalities, to extreme anxiety, and depression. I had a physically, sexually, and mentally abused upbringing. Videogames have always been an escape for me. They used to help me out tremendously with my social disorders... I used to talk to strangers all around the world. I played Socom on PS2, Rainbow Six 3 on PC, and a ton of Xbox Live on the original Xbox.. mostly Pandora Tomorrow’s multiplayer. 

However... as years went on. I started to distance myself from any and all social happenings. Even if I had friends online I would always “go offline” to hide. On Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PS4 I always just put myself into a private party so I can’t hear anyone. 

After this went on for almost a decade... I finally decided it was time to end my life. I had done nothing for society, and I always ran from people even if they tried to help. However, this attempt would prove unsuccessful, as the belt around my neck broke before I had fully succumbed. 

I don’t have hardly any family left, or a single friend. I understand it’s my fault entirely. However... today, I’m wanting to make a positive change in my life for once. 

As someone who doesn’t get out and is scared to talk to people.. you can imagine how difficult it is to make friends. 

However, I started thinking, “the internet has millions of people... maybe this message would reach a person and we would start a meaningful friendship”.  That was my thought process behind this whole post anyway. 

Why post it here, you may ask? 

Well.... Videogames are *literally* the only thing I know. I have followed this industry my whole life. It’s the only thing I know how to talk about. So I figured... if I was to make a friend, what better place to look then on the internet ^.^

In closing: if there is a kind soul out there that would be willing to be patient and understanding with me and start slow (IE: text messaging, over voice at first) it would mean the absolute world to me. 

Thank you all so much for reading.

&lt;p&gt;My name is Rob, and I have a life changing favor to ask. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have debated on making this post numerous times. However I always made an excuse to back out. I’m not sure if this is allowed here, and if it isn’t, I’m truly sorry, but this seems to be the place where I can speak directly with the kinds of people that this message is aimed at. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be an extremely personal look into mental health, and the side effects of said illnesses, but this is the last shot I could come up with. Ok... with all that being said.... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been medically diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Ranging from multiple personalities, to extreme anxiety, and depression. I had a physically, sexually, and mentally abused upbringing. Videogames have always been an escape for me. They used to help me out tremendously with my social disorders... I used to talk to strangers all around the world. I played Socom on PS2, Rainbow Six 3 on PC, and a ton of Xbox Live on the original Xbox.. mostly Pandora Tomorrow’s multiplayer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However... as years went on. I started to distance myself from any and all social happenings. Even if I had friends online I would always “go offline” to hide. On Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PS4 I always just put myself into a private party so I can’t hear anyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this went on for almost a decade... I finally decided it was time to end my life. I had done nothing for society, and I always ran from people even if they tried to help. However, this attempt would prove unsuccessful, as the belt around my neck broke before I had fully succumbed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have hardly any family left, or a single friend. I understand it’s my fault entirely. However... today, I’m wanting to make a positive change in my life for once. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who doesn’t get out and is scared to talk to people.. you can imagine how difficult it is to make friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I started thinking, “the internet has millions of people... maybe this message would reach a person and we would start a meaningful friendship”.  That was my thought process behind this whole post anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why post it here, you may ask? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well.... Videogames are &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; the only thing I know. I have followed this industry my whole life. It’s the only thing I know how to talk about. So I figured... if I was to make a friend, what better place to look then on the internet &lt;sup&gt;.^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing: if there is a kind soul out there that would be willing to be patient and understanding with me and start slow (IE: text messaging, over voice at first) it would mean the absolute world to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all so much for reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;❤️ you all &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been depressed since I was a child, have wanted to kill myself for the past decade. I’ve always felt like something was just “missing” in my brain. I’ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and fucked up pretty much every friendship I’ve ever had. I’ve gone to therapy, been on meds, was institutionalized a couple times. Nothing helps.

It’s not that I don’t love life, because I think it’s wonderful and grand. I’ve traveled a lot, and done so much. I genuinely love myself and I love painting and hiking and film and so much in life.. But I just am so tired. I’ve wanted to die for so long. And then two months ago, the love of my life killed himself. We were supposed to get married. He was the only person that I ever had any sort of connection with. He was so unbelievably wonderful and kind and I miss and love him so much. The past two months have been truly, truly horrible. I never thought I could feel so much pain. I’ve had a countless amount of horrible, sad nights due to my mental illness but none even compare. I bought heroin to kill myself. I’ve never done it, so I have no tolerance so mixing that and a few beers will surely do the job. It’s also how my boyfriend died (not an addict, but bought it to kill himself).

I’m driving across the country tomorrow. My family thinks I’m starting a new job (which I do have one lined up that I accepted as a “just in case”), but I’m really just going to travel for a couple more days, see some art museums, go on a hike, and then finally do it. Part of me is scared, but I can’t go on like this anymore. Each day has somehow gotten worse since my boyfriend died, and it’s absolutely unbearable.  I tried to kill myself a month ago and just ended up in a mental hospital that only made things worse. I’m sad about thinking about dying, but only because I’m sad that it can’t end up any other way. Both of my parents have life long mental illnesses that don’t go away, and I have no desire to end up like that. Anyway, I just wanted to tell someone. I’m a really open person, and it’s hard to not talk about this with anyone.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

&gt; Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.

&lt;p&gt;If you only have time to write one message here, sort by &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; and pick an OP who doesn&amp;#39;t have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don&amp;#39;t know what to say, that&amp;#39;s what the &lt;a href=""http://redd.it/igh87""&gt;talking tips&lt;/a&gt; are for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and &lt;em&gt;individualized&lt;/em&gt; response.  &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"It's nothing but selfishness and double standards.

You can be complaining about the cruelness and unfairness of the world with someone who agrees and even contributes to the conversation, but the moment you hint at having suicidal ideations their mind suddenly shifts and they go from talking about how the world is awful to it being this beautiful place where you can find hope in any situation. People's minds just suddenly changing like that suggests that they don't truly believe in either. Why should I have faith in your forced words?

It's perfectly okay to strip people of their homes when they're financially struggling, and it's acceptable to shove someone into a corner with little to no solutions, but committing suicide? No, you're not allowed to stop your pain. ""If you're suicidal because of a lack of money, we'll hospitalize you, do jack shit to help you, and then charge an insane amount of money for it."" And when you're released you're expected to be completely fucking cured and to go back to being a mindless, content slave. ""If you don't like being a slave, then fuck you. You can starve, because we're not going to help you. You're not useful to society so you mean absolutely nothing to us. Oh, but... don't kill yourself, because we actually care."" 

Life is shitty from the very beginning. Even as a young kid you're forced to attend school for eight hours a day and have to deal with the stress of tests and exams that determine your classes and if you're able to move forward to the next grade. Fucking 9 year old kids shouldn't have to deal with that kind of pressure. It's incredibly unfair and even as a child I knew that the education system was/is bullshit. But if you don't finish school it just makes the rest of your life even harder. You're never given a break. After or even during school, you're expected to get a job. All of the time you could have had to yourself is just gone. You never have the chance to do anything *you* want to do anymore. People stay up later and get less sleep than they should just so they can have a few hours to themselves before they have to worry about their responsibilities again. And it's a cycle that is just supposed to continue until you're too old to do anything else with your life. It's depressing shit.

Why am I mentally ill for wanting to break out of that cycle? Why are people *not* considered mentally ill for seeing this lifestyle as normal and thinking that it's possible to be happy living like that? Call me weak, lazy, etc. But I just can not mentally or physically handle the responsibilities and stress of life. It's always been too much for me. The world and everyone in it is unbelievably cruel. Situations like the one we're dealing with now just put people's natural selfishness on full display; buying everything before anyone else can, leaving their homes for unimportant reasons, etc. No one cares about anything or anyone else other than themselves. I can't seriously believe anyone who says otherwise. The proof is all around you and it's impossible to ignore.

I'm tired of all of these bullshit ""solutions"". Hospitalizing me and trapping me in a psych ward isn't going to fucking help me. It's counterproductive as shit and is just further proof that medical ""professionals"" don't know anything and lack any sort of empathy. You have to be fucked up to think that locking multiple people with different issues and illnesses together is actually effective and will help anyone. I don't care about your hotline spam and cookie-cutter ""advice"" either. No, it doesn't get better. My life has only gotten harder, and will continue to do so. You don't know me or what I'm dealing with. Stop acting like you know all the solutions to my problems, as doing so just makes you come off as incredibly ignorant. 

I don't want help by pills being shoved down my throat or by countless therapists telling me the same things but worded slightly different. I want out. Out of this life before it can get worse.

,SuicideWatch,"## I know I'm far from the biggest victim of the universe, there's plenty of people that have it far worse than me. I really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden I've been holding for a while and I just no longer know what to do.

I know y'all are busy, so I've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy I decided to highlight all of the key points:

1. **I feel so lonely**, I've never had a group of friends that I could constantly reach, this has been my life since I was a child. There's plenty of people that know me and people that I can interact with, I'm not an unlikable person but there's no one I have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. Despite this there're people that do talk to me and I've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly I don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.
2. **I have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. Simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. My bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, I feel really guilty about it.
3. In my search for love this past year, I was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** This has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when I began dating him I told everyone about him, I even told my family. He lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later I texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop ""obsessing over him"" and blocked my number that very same day. **I was so embarrassed I didn't told anyone what happened.**
4. I've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **I don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys I would particularly find attractive, however I don't know why I keep doing this.
5. **I have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person I think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. It seems that for people I'm an acceptable target to abuse.
6. I often feel **my ""friends"" just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.
7. **I constantly have suicidal thoughts**, I don't want to be here anymore and I don't understand what's the point of keeping on because I know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. Often times I could be walking near a bridge and in my head I start thinking on how can I ended it all by jumping. I've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.
8. **It's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example I can't open a tab with a YouTube video because I immediately change it.
9. For the last year I've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit I don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money I'm spending it all. I've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and I feel extremely guilty about it.
10. Last year I've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. For example, this week I've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.
11. I'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, I don't like a lot what I do and every time I show someone my work for critiques, I'm mostly met with good critiques, but I feel like they're lying to me. For some reason, deep inside me, I know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.
12. **I have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. Ever since I was little I do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time I dislike the way I'm writing.** This happens in every other aspect of my life. For example, if I don't like how I'm drawing, I rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if I don't like how my phone is organized I delete all the data and I try to reorganize it again, etc.
13. **I have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.
14. Lastly, **I feel ugly as fuck**, I have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately I know I look like a hot mess.

I feel in a state of emergency because this time I have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but I can't possibly move because I don't know what to do. I've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but I feel really weak right now and I don't know if I can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues I have, so maybe they can finally tell me if I have something. I'm desperate because I need a fix for all of this things, I'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.

,SuicideWatch,"WARNING!! Sorry for bad English

I live in Korea with mandatory military service for all boys and I'm gonna kill my life. I'm scared to go to military. I'm in a lot of worrying. I think to myself, what if I waste 2 years of my life that I could have done other things for like college? What if North Korea starts war and I have to fight and be captured and tortured for life? What if my generals and soldiers are super mean and beat me? What if tomorrow is the last day I see my family, since they might die in 2 years I am in military?

I am so sad, scared, and painful. 2 years seems short by number but boys who come out say it's longest 2 years because it's so stressful. I dont want to wake up at 5am and do hard training like crawl in mud and electric wires and toxic gas training. Plus some boys who are bad soldiers are extended time for military.

When I'm young at 10 years, I was so scared too everyday when I learn about mandatory service, and my mother always said: don't worry because when your older the law will change. But it doesn't change, and I'm very close thinking about suicide because it's so scary when I look at the clock and calendar. I have 48 hours and I think very strongly to suicide in the 48 hours. I NEVER think about suicide before but this time I do for first time in my life because of so much pain

Sorry for bad English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Korea with mandatory military service for all boys and I&amp;#39;m gonna kill my life. I&amp;#39;m scared to go to military. I&amp;#39;m in a lot of worrying. I think to myself, what if I waste 2 years of my life that I could have done other things for like college? What if North Korea starts war and I have to fight and be captured and tortured for life? What if my generals and soldiers are super mean and beat me? What if tomorrow is the last day I see my family, since they might die in 2 years I am in military?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so sad, scared, and painful. 2 years seems short by number but boys who come out say it&amp;#39;s longest 2 years because it&amp;#39;s so stressful. I dont want to wake up at 5am and do hard training like crawl in mud and electric wires and toxic gas training. Plus some boys who are bad soldiers are extended time for military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#39;m young at 10 years, I was so scared too everyday when I learn about mandatory service, and my mother always said: don&amp;#39;t worry because when your older the law will change. But it doesn&amp;#39;t change, and I&amp;#39;m very close thinking about suicide because it&amp;#39;s so scary when I look at the clock and calendar. I have 48 hours and I think very strongly to suicide in the 48 hours. I NEVER think about suicide before but this time I do for first time in my life because of so much pain&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"A bit about my son- Before he starting dating his now deceased girlfriend, he was extremely depressed. He broke up with his girlfriend who was his best friend before. That absolutely crushed him. He used to be the happiest kid ever! He hung out with friends and was all around just a happy person. After that happened he became very cold and distant. He hated to go out with family and wanted to be alone.  He mistrusted everyone and even mistrusted his mother, my wife. He claimed that she was a liar and was manipulating me to get him in trouble. HE thought of everyone like that. 

 Anyway a few years ago he meet a girl, who I’ll call Emma, and he did a complete 180. He was happy again and became a better person all around. He always told me how much he loved her. I don’t think Ive ever seen two people in love as him and Emma. She was so ingrained in our family that she started to come to family reunions we would have with our cousins every few months. His depression never really went away though. He went through bouts of being extremely sad, but he always found a way to “plateau” himself. Emma, however, has had it much worst. He told me that she was beaten by her father, and how she had to grow up early because when she, her mother and her sister moved out, her mother became an alcoholic and was unable to take care of them.

She and my son moved into an apartment and have been living together for a little while now. About a month ago he called me on the phone and his voice was very shaky. He told me that she tried to kill herself with his own gun. He told me that he took a week off of work to be with her. He also told me that he was going to talk with some therapists. That takes us to 5 days ago. I got a call from him and he was crying a lot. After about 1 minute or so he finally collected his voice and told me that she had killed herself. He told me that and I got in my car and drove 2 hours to where he lived. When I got there, he was cleaning blood out of the carpet. He stood up and there was still blood on his clothes. I gave him a hug and he starting crying. He kept saying things like: “It was my fault” and “I could have stopped her”. He told me that when they woke up that morning, she wanted a snack, so he went out to get her a snack. When he came back, he found her on the floor with her wrists slit. She was barely alive so he ran to he and tried to help her by putting pressure on her wounds. He said that she died in his arms.

At the funeral when her casket was being lowered, he didn't cry at all, he just stared at it. He had this blank expression on his face. After it was lowered and people were shoveling dirt into the hole, he just started walking away. He walked passed his car and was walking toward the entrance of the cemetery. We called out to him but he continued to walk. I caught up to him and I turned him around and told him that I wanted to help him through what he was going through. He looked coldly and said, “I have nothing to say to you”. He looked like he wasn’t there. I could see it in his eyes. It was as if his body was talking, but he wasn’t. Its hard to explain. He turned away and continued to walk. We later found him wandering aimlessly around town.

 I went to visit him today. Since I'm a cosigner of his apartment I have an extra key.  I found him passed out on his desk and bottle of vodka in his hand. In his other hand I noticed that there was something in his hands. I opened it up and what I saw made me cry. There was a box with a wedding ring. He was going to propose to her! How can I help my son with what he’s going through? I don’t know what to do. I feel like Im not doing enough.

,SuicideWatch,"We've learned that someone is reaching out to ""help"" some of our OPs via PM, tricking them into clicking links that go to IP tracing sites, and passing the information on to police.  **We cannot overstate how much we deplore this reprehensible and frankly stupid behaviour!**

As a suicide intervention strategy, it's beyond misguided, and likely to cause more suffering and death than it prevents (see below).  Further, it's a violation of both our subreddit rules, and reddit's TOS.  We, with the help of the reddit admin team, are doing all we can behind the scenes to put a stop to this, but the anonymous nature of reddit means that people can sometimes find ways around the counter-measures, so please be forewarned.  

If you're here to **get** help, please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules, and please report and then ignore any responses or PMs you get that violate them.  Consider whether you actually want help from someone who either doesn't care enough to learn the rules of the community before participating, or who thinks they are above the rules or know better than we do.  The SW mod team, collectively, has about 40 years' experience in suicide intervention and related mental-health and human services fields.  All of our rules exist for excellent reasons!

If you're here to **give** help, please read and follow the rules.  We know that the points in section 4 of the guidelines may seem counter-intuitive - that's why all of them link to mod posts where we discuss the rationale in detail. All of these rules were arrived at in collaboration with, and with the overwhelming support of, the SW community. The rule about keeping interactions out in public is designed to ensure that bad advice gets debugged, and that our helpers don't get overwhelmed or overcommitted and end up letting people down. ***Most of the problems we end up dealing with in modmail are the result of helpers violating the one or more of rules in section 4, whether deliberately or inadvertently.***

I also want to say a bit about the SW mod team's philosophy regarding confidentiality.  We don't believe in ""outing"" anyone who posts here unless there's a credible threat of harm to *others*.  We know that anonymity makes it possible for people who are having really dark thoughts to open up and talk about things without fear of having it come back to haunt them, or without fear of people making assumptions about them based on their personal history.  Anonymity is in itself a safety measure in suicide intervention, and the rare cases where it leads to a bad outcome are not typical - they're like the freak-accident scenarios where someone is strangled by a safety harness or smothered by an airbag.   

There seems to be a widespread perception that calling police and arranging an involuntary intervention is the only/best thing to do when someone expresses any kind suicidal ideation - that's absolutely not true! Suicide hotlines don't do this very often at all. For example, the hotline I work at breaches confidentiality roughly 0.2  percent of the time - that's **once in 500 calls**, even though almost every call involves some degree of suicidal ideation. An involuntary intervention is regarded as a failure - having your privacy violated is incredibly traumatic and it *always* sets people back, so hotlines do everything they can do avoid it.  

Hotlines welcome calls from concerned third parties. If you encounter someone anywhere who you think may be at risk for suicide, we strongly recommend that, unless you have sound reason to believe that a suicide attempt is already in progress, your first call should be to your local or national suicide hotline. They can do an expert risk assessment in real time, and quickly help you identify the best next steps. If *they* suggest calling the police, then of course you should do so, but most of the time they'll offer you a less drastic and more therapeutic way to help the person you're concerned for.

&lt;p&gt;As a suicide intervention strategy, it&amp;#39;s beyond misguided, and likely to cause more suffering and death than it prevents (see below).  Further, it&amp;#39;s a violation of both our subreddit rules, and reddit&amp;#39;s TOS.  We, with the help of the reddit admin team, are doing all we can behind the scenes to put a stop to this, but the anonymous nature of reddit means that people can sometimes find ways around the counter-measures, so please be forewarned.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re here to &lt;strong&gt;get&lt;/strong&gt; help, please familiarize yourself with the subreddit rules, and please report and then ignore any responses or PMs you get that violate them.  Consider whether you actually want help from someone who either doesn&amp;#39;t care enough to learn the rules of the community before participating, or who thinks they are above the rules or know better than we do.  The SW mod team, collectively, has about 40 years&amp;#39; experience in suicide intervention and related mental-health and human services fields.  All of our rules exist for excellent reasons!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re here to &lt;strong&gt;give&lt;/strong&gt; help, please read and follow the rules.  We know that the points in section 4 of the guidelines may seem counter-intuitive - that&amp;#39;s why all of them link to mod posts where we discuss the rationale in detail. All of these rules were arrived at in collaboration with, and with the overwhelming support of, the SW community. The rule about keeping interactions out in public is designed to ensure that bad advice gets debugged, and that our helpers don&amp;#39;t get overwhelmed or overcommitted and end up letting people down. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the problems we end up dealing with in modmail are the result of helpers violating the one or more of rules in section 4, whether deliberately or inadvertently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to say a bit about the SW mod team&amp;#39;s philosophy regarding confidentiality.  We don&amp;#39;t believe in &amp;quot;outing&amp;quot; anyone who posts here unless there&amp;#39;s a credible threat of harm to &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt;.  We know that anonymity makes it possible for people who are having really dark thoughts to open up and talk about things without fear of having it come back to haunt them, or without fear of people making assumptions about them based on their personal history.  Anonymity is in itself a safety measure in suicide intervention, and the rare cases where it leads to a bad outcome are not typical - they&amp;#39;re like the freak-accident scenarios where someone is strangled by a safety harness or smothered by an airbag.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a widespread perception that calling police and arranging an involuntary intervention is the only/best thing to do when someone expresses any kind suicidal ideation - that&amp;#39;s absolutely not true! Suicide hotlines don&amp;#39;t do this very often at all. For example, the hotline I work at breaches confidentiality roughly 0.2  percent of the time - that&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;once in 500 calls&lt;/strong&gt;, even though almost every call involves some degree of suicidal ideation. An involuntary intervention is regarded as a failure - having your privacy violated is incredibly traumatic and it &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; sets people back, so hotlines do everything they can do avoid it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hotlines welcome calls from concerned third parties. If you encounter someone anywhere who you think may be at risk for suicide, we strongly recommend that, unless you have sound reason to believe that a suicide attempt is already in progress, your first call should be to your local or national suicide hotline. They can do an expert risk assessment in real time, and quickly help you identify the best next steps. If &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; suggest calling the police, then of course you should do so, but most of the time they&amp;#39;ll offer you a less drastic and more therapeutic way to help the person you&amp;#39;re concerned for.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I know that when my wife was younger she struggled with suicidal thoughts, but she has continued therapy for the last 18 years and largely been successful.  We've been married for nearly 4 years now and it's a particularly stressful time due to finances, my transitioning to a new job, several major problems with our home, and a viscous lawsuit from a neighbor who wanted our dog.  (Was dismissed but took a year to get to court and was very stressful.)

She seemed to be in fairly high spirits the last three days and this morning was in a particularly good mood.  As the morning went on we talked, I told her how happy I was she'd saved my favorite shirt from a stain, and she was laughing and joking with me.  She decided to do some chores and I played Xbox.  About an hour later I got up to get a drink and noticed she wasn't in the main portion of the house so I went upstairs to check on her.  Found her in bed with a bottle of muscle relaxers I got for a bad back and a bottle of her own daily mood stabilizers.  She had taken about 27 muscle relaxers and around 150 of the mood stabilizers in addition to a full bottle of Tylenol, and she had attempted to use razors to slash her wrists and throat.  Thankfully she is very afraid of cutting herself and was not successful.  I carried her downstairs and took her to the ER.  (Didn't know how many pills she had taken or would have called 911, thought it had been much less.). Took the bottles with me and they sedated her and put her on a breather.  It was absolutely terrifying.
She is in ICU but Tennessee has some rule where nobody can see or visit her until the doctor decides they can so I'm sitting at home trying to decide what to do.  I'm not allowed to call or be there so I got a nurse to let me write her a letter telling her I love her and that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to support her through this rough time.

I've noticed when she drinks she tends to get more depressed, so when I got home I dumped all the alcohol in the house.  I like beer but not as much as I liked her.  Hopefully keeping something that triggers her out of the house will help some.  I kind of feel like I'm taking her choices away though and I want her to feel independent and worthwhile not like a child who is in trouble.  Do you all think this is the right call?

Has anyone had experience with this in Tennessee and if so how long did it take for you to see/be seen by your loved ones?

Since she took my prescription is there any chance of criminal charges?  I don't care about the pills or lawyer bills I just don't think she needs to experience another trial.

Can the state forcibly put her in a treatment facility and if not as her husband can I put her in an outpatient program?  I think she will want to act like this didn't happen but I want her to get help.

If I can put her in an outpatient program do y'all think it would be a positive? Again I want her to feel free and validated.

What things can I do to better prep our home to be a safer environment while she's works through this?

,SuicideWatch,"Three years ago, I was in the worst place of my life. I had undergone a prolonged and horrific traumatic experience the year before, and then was thrust back into normal life as a ""typical"" high school student. I was surrounded by people who supported my abusers, and felt that what had happened to me was my fault (and people supported this idea). 

And then, I had a glimmer of hope that was so wonderful and unimaginable that not only would all my troubles be subsided, but I felt that it would make all my troubles *worth it*. But alas, I made a very stupid mistake, and I alone sabotaged myself. 

I joined Reddit and found this subreddit, and [cried for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1swjeq/what_do_you_live_for_when_you_dont_have_anything/?). Redditers were patient and understanding. 

Of course, I thought much of what they told me (it got better, other great things would happen to me, I would learn to live with my regrets) was bullshit. It annoyed me at the time, though I was warmed by the fact that people sought to comfort me. My mind was going in circles. It was stagnant. I had never experienced that. It was a very dark time.

I had to push through another year - and it was perhaps the hardest year of my life - but somehow, I made it through. You couldn't pay me anything to relive that time. Through fantastically random events, I got the opportunity to leave home and have a ""fresh start,"" and then went off to college, where I was able to think with a clear mind. It wasn't an easy transition. It was easy in some aspects - I wasn't homesick, like others in my college freshman dorm - but looking back on it, it was an adjustment. 

I am now much further into college. Wonderful things have happened in my life, and I truly do like living. It's not that I get up everyday and short, ""I love life!"" But three years ago, if I had a chance to just disappear and stop living in a small, painless instant, I would take it in a heartbeat. Now, I would not. I have had opportunities that are very different from the one I messed up. I can't compare them to the one I lost - it's not that one is better than others; they are merely different. I have been honored to have wonderful experiences that I couldn't have imagined three years ago. 

Back then, I wracked with guilt and shame, hatred for myself and for many others. I hated when people would say, ""It gets better"" because I felt it applied to everyone, but me. But it did. Things did get better.
